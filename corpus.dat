It's completely stupid.
At least here in the south this wouldn't be seen badly.
Dude thought watermelon would be a nice gesture, who doesn't love watermelon?!
Black people like watermelon and fried chicken  You know who else likes watermelon and fried chicken  EVERYONE can confirm, I'm white as fresh fallen snow and I would love some fried chicken and watermelon right now.
Hispanic here: me gusta la sandía y el pollo frito!
Korean here, give me some 수박 and fried 닭. African American here, hate watermelon.
Double up the chicken on my serving.
Native American here, everyone took my friend chicken and watermelon.
Fried chicken here, why does no one care about the suffering of my people.
Colonel Sanders says to Gobbles, "I'm going to kill millions of chickens and one clown."
Gobbles asks, "Why the clown?"
Colonel Sanders responds, "See, no one cares about the chickens."
* Edited to add: originally this was a stalin/hitler joke, and in the Hitler version, it's Goebels.
However, I can't ever spell Goebels right, and Gobbles seemed funnier in this circumstance.
Black American, here.
You got any more of them fried chickens?
I could go for a chicken dinner.
winner winner... chicken dinner They are racists against white and dark meat.
Austria checking in I love me some Backhendl and Wassermelone!
Sorry to hear about your friend chicken.
Sounds like he was a delicious friend for someone else.
I thought I was the only person on the planet who didn't like watermelon.
Fried chicken is fucking awesome though.
Yo thought I was the only one who hated watermelon too.
Made me stupid sick as a kid now I can't even stand the smell of it.
The best chicken places we have where I'm at are Korean.
So fucking good.
There’s an amazing Chicago style pizza place in my neighborhood that has a pizza with Korean fried chicken from another area place and it’s pretty much the best thing ever.
The one food thing we *don't* have here that i'd really love is a proper Chicago Style Pizza place.
Fried chicken 'n **Hite* Stoner here: watermelon and chicken is what the doctor ordered.
Yum.
I’m a Mexican from SoCal, and I always thought el pollo loco was shit.
It’s not really about the quality, I just think fried chicken is so much better than grilled.
Get yourself to Jolibee, man!
I identify as an Attack Helicopter and I still love fried chicken and watermelon!
I identify as a were-hedgehog, and I love fried chicken and watermelon.
*  The Hedgehog-American Cultural Association approves this message.
White as mayonnaise here.
Can confirm summertime barbeques include fried chicken and watermelon.
I'm a white Canadian and Chicken and Waffles (with that fine Canadian maple syrup) is to fucking die for &gt; I'm white as fresh fallen snow  Stop triggering people with your whiteness!
Credit: Dave Chapelle That was a nice looking watermelon too.
I grew up around a big watermelon farming area and it's almost a habit to bring one to any event that people are bringing food to.
Nobody would ever think there was any racial undertones to it, they'd think "this is a damn fine melon, thanks" Only a racist doesn't like watermelon I was never a fan of watermelon you go back to where you came from Exactly.
Some people are too sensitive.
I just had a discussion about this with other redditors.
People need to grow the hell up &gt; Some people are too sensitive.
It's all about context really.
If you dress up in black face and overalls while doing ridiculous things with Watermellon talking like Jar Jar binks then yea, you're being pretty fucking racist.
Bringing watermellon to work is delicious.
Agreed, it's all about context.
Intent is also important.
Le'ts say hypothetically that him bringing a watermelon in to work actually was a racial joke for his coworkers.
There wasn't any evil intent behind it and it was probably a well received one with his friends and coworkers.
Believe it or not, friends of all races will make offensive and racist jokes to each other.
Not everyone walks around with a stick up their ass 24/7.
But apparently there is a zero tolerance joke policy.
Unfortunately we've entered this weird age where people actually say that others can't joke about certain things.
Even if they have nothing to do with the situation and everyone involved in it took it as a joke.
Some people can't even handle it if you say that your sense of humor is none of their business.
Yeah, I read a pretty ridiculous article a month or so ago where basically two members of an orchestra (one white, one black) were just casually talking back and forth while walking.
A lady overheard the white person say something in a southern accent to the black person and took offense to it, deeming it blatant racism.
She reported the "incident" and that person was released from the orchestra.
She took offense to a joke that was not only not involving her, it wasn't racial at all.
Fuck people like her.
Some people have a hard time finding a worthy mission in life for their activism.
They missed the chance to be a civil rights photographer in the '60s so they settle for advancing the science of being offended in the school paper or their blog.
Which is unfortunate since there are so many good causes to still fight for in this day and age.
And heck they pop up like every day.
Doesn't help that schools teach kids these days that they should be out there, saving the world.
Definitely some of this going on.
I think there's just a heightened sensitivity now too - thanks internet!
It's funny because growing up the Internet and online games genuinely desensitized me to things like being made fun of but it made me aware of legitimate criticism.
These days a lot of people have the exact opposite mindset.
You know, people always complain about trolls on the internet, but even as a carefully-worded, compassionate person I have offended people.
And apologizing afterwards isn't even enough.
It's a little ridiculous.
Calling people a troll is a deflection now.
Be polite when you argue, but don't apologize for having a different viewpoint.
Just make sure you argue in good faith and always call out bad faith arguments.
Good suggestions.
What I usually run into are misunderstandings due to the fact that we don't have facial ques and tone of voice to help, so being that I'm pretty sarcastic doesn't help either.
But sometimes even when I explain myself I've come to realize that sometimes people are looking for things to offend them...and that's when I just walk away.
We currently live in a time where it is both fashionable and desirable to be seen as sensitive and supportive of diversity.
As such, anything that could in any way be seen as even the least bit controversial, racist, bigoted, or anything but supportive of any particular group/race/ethnicity/minority (with the exception of those that have been identified as The Problem(tm)) is cause for immediate firing, social expulsion, and mandatory sensitivity reeducation.
YOU WILL CELEBRATE DIVERSITY BY CONFORMING TO THE PREVAILING SOCIAL OPINIONS WE DEEM TO BE CORRECT, CITIZEN.
Yeah this firing was bullshit.
Had he brought them watermelon, chicken, grape soda and menthol cigarettes then yes fire his racist ass.
But just bringing them all some watermelon?
Fuck me really?
I can never offer a black man watermelon without being racist?
&gt; He is brought them watermelon, chicken, grape soda and menthol cigarettes then yes fire his racist ass.
Do you still fire him even if it's a joke and his coworkers come to his defense?
Or is there a zero tolerance joke policy?
Nope, ya can't lol.
Also, what's wrong with bringing someone stereotypical food?
If I was brought a pot of borscht I wouldn't get upset.
I don't think Mexicans would protest at Mexican foods.
The south in the United States also shares a lot of cultural with things that are supposed to be "stereotypically" black.
To me, the real racism lies in being offended.
If you give someone something as a good gesture and they get offended, that's not your fault.
They don't own food lol.
In their head they're thinking "I should be offended by this" but they never ask themselves why.
If they critically thought about it I think they'd change their mind.
I'm mexican and would love it if you brought me beans and tortillas.
We are friends so I can get some of your grandma's tamales at Christmas, not for me to be feeding you sub par beans and tortillas.
If someone offered me 1 million dollars but I could only eat beans/rice and tortillas for the rest of my life, I would absolutely do it.
If someone brought me some stereotypical British food, I'd get upset, because it is awful.
Legit laugh out loud from this comment.
Thank you.
When I was in the US, I would have killed for some good, homemade chicken curry.
I was thinking it was a healthy alternative to donuts or other junk food you can bring in to your first day.
Had it been a fruit tray and not just a watermelon, i think there would have been a lot less drama It's because someone got stereotype and racism confused.
Seriously, it never even occured to the guy there was any kind of racial connection.
Just a nice guy trying to be nice.
Ironically, the real racists are the people who thought this was racist.
Allergic to watermelon, sucks.
The only reason I remember how they taste is because of candy.
I have completely forgotten how cantaloupe tastes.
Watermelon candy doesn't really taste like watermelon.
Dude, let him keep his dream.
Well, is it better or worse?
These people are wrong don’t listen to them.
Watermelon flavored candy is like lickin Jesus’ nipples.
I need to know how you could possibly know this.
I’ve known Jesus.
It just doesn't resemble the flavor in any way.
[deleted] Juicy isn't really a taste though, that's more of a texture.
Banana flavored candy tastes terrible.
I have a banana almost every day.
I hate the banana runts.
I just use them for scale in pictures to confuse people.
I have the same kind of problem with artificial lime flavoring.
Real limes are fine, artificial lime is an abomination.
That is because the banana candy flavor is for the [Gros Michel Banana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gros_Michel_banana) which had an issue with Panama Disease in the 50s, we now get [Cavendish Bananas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_banana) since then.
Modern bananas don't taste like the candy, but the candy does taste like bananas, though about as similarly as the watermelon candy does.
Well first Watermelon tastes way more water-down than the candy.
Id say worse, but not persay its bad, but watermelon is good.
You know what i mean?
It definitely does not capture the melon expereince Same here!
I used to eat a lot of it and then one day, got super sick from it.
Tried again five years later, same thing happened.
Can't eat cantaloupe or honey melon either.
Ordering a fruit salad is pretty much impossible.
Felt like crying reading this.
Would be torture to go without watermelon or cantaloupe during summer.
You will be in my thoughts.
(Bit of exaggeration in that last part.)
There's this Japanese cantaloupe candy that tastes disturbingly like the real thing.
Maybe it was honeydew.
It's been a while.
Anyway, it was really good.
You might try locating an Asian market.
I can't eat a lot of fruits because of fructose malabsorption and Japanese candy is my savior.
It's those melon Kasugi fruit gummies.
They carry them at World Market stores.
The kiwi ones are my other faves.
And the mango ones, and the... ooh, the grape ones!
And the strawberry ones!!!
Thanks for the heads up!
I think I found them on amazon under the name Kasugai.
The reviews say it is a cross between honey-dew and cantaloupe.
I ordered a package.
Watermelon candy is delicious, but I don't like watermelon... sooo, I think you're doing okay.
Can you imagine if the reverse happened and a black firefighter were fired by a white commissioner for something so stupid?
I feel like people would be more upset and it would be a much bigger story.
Oh they would be.
But we're in an Era where we hire people based on skin color so it wouldn't surprise me lol.
I feel like racism is talked about more than it is actually present.
People always try to attribute motive to someone's actions.
[Relevant ](https://youtu.be/XeQ0zm-njyQ) This is so off topic but ironically hilarious, still.
I have a sister and her dad is white.
She hates watermelon.
She's is the 37 and I'm 9 years younger and I've never, ever seen her eat any.
She has them shipped to my mom, overnight because my mom loves them (and lives in Alaska ) but she refuses to even eat candy that is watermelon flavored.
All four of my other siblings and myself love watermelon!
She also refuses to eat any meat off a bone.
Like, I buffalo chicken wings and barbecue, etc...
Shipping watermelons to Alaska sounds expensive!
This is why "zero tolerance" policies are bad, they tie administrators hands by removing context from a situation.
"Zero tolerance" policies are often (poorly) executed as "someone filed a complaint, so you're fired" with no investigation or room for any defense.
I can think of no situation where context is irrelevant, and very few where it's unimportant.
"Zero tolerance" is just a stupid administrative gimmick to protect themselves.
Schools up here do it (Canada), and it's fucking retarded.
Kid A punches Kid B, Kid B doesn't respond.
Both get suspended.
Exactly, it actually incentivizes kids to go full blast in fights.
“Oh I’m gonna get suspended for being a victim/bystander to violence, might as well defend myself Hard.” Yeah like why would you not kick their teeth in when the consequences are gonna be the same as if you'd been the bigger man and just taken an asswhooping?
Not sure if I'd consider "taken an asswhooping" being the bigger man.
I wouldn't think less of someone for defending themselves, especially if it's just a single punch or two to dissuade the initiator from trying to press further.
Yeah, but the point is that you could also get punched once and not retaliate, and have the same punishment as getting punched once and beating the absolute daylights out of the other person to the point of injury.
I'd say the former is being the bigger man, but both have equal punishment.
I understood the point as a whole and I agree that it is ludicrous.
I was just taking issue with the implication that not retaliating at all is "being the bigger man," as if it's better than physically responding to defend yourself.
Ah yes, I misunderstood then.
I agree completely, just "taking it" is *not* the only way to be the bigger man.
I was bullied pretty hard in elementary school-middle school.
At one point I just decided hey, I’m taller and stronger tgan this kid, he’s gotten me in school suspension twice, I might as well just fuck him up.
Week later, he hits me after school, i punch him in the head and kick his back when he falls over.
The vice principle, who knew exactly what was going on, gave me a day of out-of-school suspension.
My dad took me to the Science Center to check out their new rocket exhibit 🙂 My parents would have done the same, supportive parents are great.
Their policy was "don't start it, but don't be afraid to finish it."
And so long as I followed that they wouldn't punish me; never did get that sort of free day off, but knowing that I'd be fine at home made me less afraid of bullies.
It also discourages outsiders from breaking up a fight or protecting someone from a bully.
If you involve yourself in the altercation at all you will likely get suspended too.
Zero tolerance is one of the stupidest ideas ever.
It defends administrators from actually having to make a decision that they might get criticized for.
The decision is pre-kitted into the policy so they can diffuse responsibility for their actions.
This exactly.
A large company in the city I live in had a policy like this.
A few years ago, there was a case in the news about a murder that happened there.
Basically, this woman who worked there was being stalked by a guy who also worked there.
They both went to HR, and they basically said "if either of you bring this up again, we'll fire both of you".
A while later, the guy ended up trying to kidnap the woman.
He got caught and murdered her in the parking lot.

/s You're officially a nazi now I'm white and male.
I remember watermelon being a bit of a summer tradition when I was a kid.
For, like, everybody.
Someone on the street has a watermelon?
Kids swarm from all directions.
That's cultural appropriation yo.
Real talk.
Was on a bus from NYC to Columbus Ohio.
Got on board first and this older black gentleman sits next to me and we start chatting about the journey.
We discuss movies, things we did in NYC and why we're heading to Columbus.
We start chatting about food and one of the best chicken places I've ever been to (raising Cane's) just so happens to have a lot of stores in Columbus.
We're chatting and I tell him about this chicken place.
Straightest face ever he goes "What, you think just because I'm black I like chicken??"
Without hesitation I responded "nah man, everyone loves chicken."
He laughed.
I laughed.
It was a good trip.
Living in Philadelphia way back when, I realized very quickly that many black people I met there will pull your leg and not let go just to watch you squirm and then laugh their asses off at you for getting uncomfortable.
You mastered your response.
I'm the king of making people feel uncomfortable.
What's your best line?
1/4g line of cocaine,after 2 minutes tell them they are acting weird.
It appears to be silence.
Damn, he's good.
Not the Brother Mouzone looking dudes on Lehigh selling Pot Pies.
Every time I talk about fried chicken  or watermelon (i fucking love those foods) to anyone who's black and I get the   "Oh I black so I must like fried chicken??"
My response "what kinda weirdo doesn't like them?"
Normally quells any racey overtones.
Also: How the fuck do people not like fried chicken and watermelon.
That shits the bomb.
People don't actually think you're racist.
They're poking fun at you because making white people uncomfortable about race is fucking funny.
It sucks you have to go through such lengths to not appear racially insensitive.
I like watermelon every now and then, but I'm not a big fan of chicken (I must be a weirdo along with some people that are allergic to poultry).
Steak on the other hand.. Im allergic to all meat except seafood :[ Such lengths?
It's just one line to show you aren't racist.
I'm black and sometimes I need that reassurance because you really just don't know sometimes.
They could be making a chicken joke because everyone loves chicken, or they are assholes.
I've seen enough of both to just never be sure.
Come on now.
Water melon is ok, but it's no fried chicken.
I'm not a canes fan.
If you absolutely need sauce to make the chicken taste good you don't have good chicken.
If you need salt to make your food taste good you don't have good food.
Raising Cane's is the best chicken.
Upvote for Raising Canes, it's miles above Zaxbys and Abners Just bath me in that sauce and toasted bread I've lived about half a mile from one of them for a year and haven't gone yet...
I'm guessing you recommend I try it?
Today I learned my garden full of watermelons is racist.
Only if you are white and sharing them with a black coworker, apparently.
You have a garden full of watermelons now?!?!?
Grow them every years.
I eat some and put the rest in a bucket by my house for the low income people around me.
Servers 2 purposes.
1.
It gives them a nice free snack.
2.
Some of them are gang members and ex cons.
While 3 of my neighbors have had their houses and caes broken into mine remains untouched.
Have you ever done the Watermelon Crawl?
Lol have to get on the felons' good side.
No one attacks the dude giving free watermelon Especially not if they're...  ( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■  (⌐■_■)  waterfelons *sigh’s and hits like* A bucket full of watermelon by the road where I grew up would be gone as soon as you took your eyes off it.
Animals love to nom that stuff.
No kidding.
We tried growing some one time but the deer simply had a field day you need to move.
seriously.
Why?
They live in a neighborhood where they never get robbed.
Yea...and it's not a good selling point: "Every house has been robbed except for this one" Which is why, if the poster owns the house, they can't move.
In a high crime neighborhood, houses sell for a lot of nothing.
If the poster is lucky, the neighborhood might gentrify, then he/she would make $$ selling.
Manufactured outrage fails again.
Good job Detroit F.D.
Not quite, dude still got fired.
Why is a watermelon racist?
What is the history of it?
It became a stereotype because when the recently freed slaves started to have their own farms, watermelon was one of the cheaper things to plant.
So many southerners started associating watermelon with the black community.
It's really a shame it's considered a stereotypical thing for black people to enjoy.
If anything it should have been looked on as a symbol of freedom and independence.
Through watermelon they were finally free to live life the way they wanted to.
I like this take on it much better.
Feels more wholesome this way.
As a side not though I'm not a fan of watermelon myself.
&gt; they were finally free to live life the way they wanted to.
Well, on the right track at least And...watermelon (along with black eyed peas, okra, coffee (!!)
and others were brought from Africa to the US by slaves who somehow stowed the seeds away.
What was an amazing thing was turned into a racial slur.
edit: collards are NOT from Africa but Africans coined the cooking method that southerners enjoy today.
Collard greens are European.
&gt;And...watermelon (along with black eyed peas, collard greens and others) were brought from Africa to the US by slaves who somehow stowed the seeds away.
What was an amazing thing was turned into a racial slur.
TIL: Blacks = Southern Whites.
Seriously this is all shit Southern Whites love, too.
BlackPeopleTwitter could easily be SouthernHonkyTwitter  if you removed the anti-conservative bias.
Sue back for racial based firing.
They wouldn't have fired him if he was black and brought in a watermelon.
It was because he was white.
This uncle tom motherfucker brought in a watermelon!
Either there's something missing from the story or the investigators thought it was better to double down on their fuckup and fire him than answer any questions about it, I'm not sure which.
&gt; Pattison, a probationary firefighter, decided to bring a watermelon wrapped in a pink ribbon.
We're told some African-American firefighters were instantly offended, since 90 percent of the people who work at Engine 55 are black.
This is partly why racism will never go away – people completely disregard people's intentions when they accuse someone or something of being racist.
Damn and to think years ago when i would bring Watermelon to work and share with some of my co workers I thought I just liked Watermelon...
Turns out I am a racist piece of shit.
Who knew.
By today's standards, we all are unfortunately regardless of our actions or intentions.
Time for a big opps and rehire.
Also those African American's who complained should shunned.
Watermelon is delicious.
Things are not racist.
Words are not racist.
Its the intention behind those things and words that make it racist.
That isn't true anymore.
Granted logically, and linguistically you're correct, but that isn't how the outraged masses view things anymore.
Spot on.
I still would never drop an n-bomb in Harlem, regardless of the context.
Common sense.
Oh yeah?
You say that now, but what if a European terrorist with a vendetta placed bombs around a major metropolitan area and forced you to go to harlem and say the n word?
Maybe wear a placard with the n word emblazoned on it.
If you were a badass you'd do it.
I'm not John McClain.
Sam Jackson probably won't be there to pull my ass off the frying pan.
As a Hispanic man if someone showed up to my house with a fucking pinata!
We'd love them so much they'd immediately become an honorary family member and we'd drink coronas all night!
So these things are hit or miss but I'd let you know I never missed a pinata!
I'm mexican if someone brought me tacos, racist or not, I'd be happy as fuck.
I'm Puerto Rican and I wouldn't even tell them wrong culture.
I'm white, and if someone brought me mayonnaise, I'd cry.
:( I fucking hate mayo.
Top 10 anime friendships So fruit these days is offensive?
Now I get why no one likes vegans... dude's name is Robert Pattinson, the same as the guy who played the vampire from Twilight.
Mildly interesting.
White people eat more watermelon than black people It doesn't matter what color you are, watermelon's f'ing delicious.
Same goes for meat that's dredged in flour and deep fried.
It's not racist, just come down to the south, everybody loves that stuff.
Political correctness strikes again.
I bring watermelon to things all the time, its literally one of the best things to bring because everyone likes it and they are cheap.
What should he have brought, Mangos?
Have you ever tried to cut up a Mango, there is juice and shit everywhere and you can never get all the god damn flesh off the fucking seed and it gets your hands all mother fucking sticky and GOD DAMMIT I HATE MANGOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your lips to God's ears, brocephus.
I bought a Mango recently to add to some fruit I was running through my juicer.
What a pain in the ass!
Cutting that thing up was ridiculous.
Half the juice was lost on the cutting board.
Fuck Mangos.
Sounds like y'all need to learn how to cut a mango.
Wow, that's ludicrous.
Even if the man brought the watermelon because the individuals were black, who cares?
The extent of the message being sent is that black people like watermelon, Oh, heavens no!
That's so offensive!
The watermelon has zero negative associations in society, it's just a fruit.
It's not like it's an insult to say someone eats or enjoys watermelon...Actually, I think you'd be much more likely to be made fun of if you didn't like watermelon.
Watermelon is fucking delicious.
it's only racist if you want it be.
dude brought a watermelon to work.
I need some context here.
Did he bring a watermelon for his personal enjoyment?
Did he toss it to a group of black coworkers with a faux-magnanimous "heard you darkies love this stuff?"
Was it his turn in the "Watermelon Wednesdays" rotation?
He absolutely could have brought it as a prop in a racially-tinged joke, or it could have been an innocuous snack... it really depends on the context.
In Chinese there is a slang called 吃瓜群众 "crowds nearby eating melons", which means spectators unrelated but interested in how the subject matter goes.
Apparently, we Chinese are all racist now.
Screw political correctness China produces more watermelon than any other country.
I am sick of black people stealing our culture and using it to oppress white people.
/s &gt;Chinese are all racist.
I've been trying to make this point for years This is retarded.
Remind me to never bring a watermellon or my granny's famous "Racist Nazi casserole" to the next BBQ Racists stereotypes going to ruin sharing one of the best summer time snacks :( If the firehouse were more diverse, someone of the wrong race bringing in a food item wouldn't be an issue.
The original article mentions bringing donuts.
Maybe he thought watermelon, which is delicious and healthier than donuts, would be a better option?
So white people can't bring watermelons to a function if it has too many black people?
As a black male, this is completely retarded.
Hey White people if you bring a watermelon to a function I'm at, I'm going to eat the shit out of it and say thank you.
So I guess if someone from another race brings me a sleeve of crackers...
They would be really cheap.
Who gives crackers without some sort of meat or cheese?
Or some nice almond butter and banana slices?
Good Americans standing up for other Americans.
So if he would have brought buckets of KFC it would have offended the same people I imagine.
This is why we can't have nice things.
Sometimes watermelon is just a delicious treat.
Really one of the dumbest stereotypes.
This kind of BS ruins a good summer pot luck.
Is this another cultural appropriation thing, like the Portland tortilla fiasco?
I took a welding class once.
One of my classmates, a guy from Florida, of Haitian descent, advised me that welding should 'sound like chicken frying'.
I repeated this advice to another guy, also Black but from Seattle thinking it must be ok because the Haitian gy said it.
Seattle guy did not agree.
I thought it was funny, but kept it to myself.
Of course it wasnt racist.
This is just the PC culture we have created where we have to find the next thing to blame the evil white males for.
Thanks Twitter!
Really?...
Obvious real racial injustice in America but you wanna throw a fit over a watermelon.
Guy works with all black dudes, really think he's racist?
If you do ok I get it, if your being a sensitive fuckass then you're part of the problem.
This is why people hate BLM and social justice warriors.
Too often it's upper middle class white people trying to make a circus out of everything for likes and attention.
Meanwhile like a tenth of young black men will be imprisoned, often on evidence that would lead to an acquittal if they were a cop, and hundreds are killed each year who'd be taken alive and rehabilitated in the EU.
Probably came out of his garden that he worked really hard on too.
Always, always do the normal, typical, uncreative thing when starting a new job.
Bring in bagels, muffins, or doughnuts.
If you're starting the afternoon shift, cookies are ok.
But nothing pre-boxed.
Has to be bakery.
Source: TV's Dexter Actually the guy who fired him is racist.
It's fucking food and your the guy perpetuating that a food could be racist.
