Let the chips fall where they may.Agree.  Politics is dirty business.  I hate the phrase *drain the swamp* but the sentiment is true.  There is a ton of dark money in the system and we can't keep saying, "I know - whatcha gonna do?"  It's graft.that is the point.it should not be dirty business. if this mueller fella flushes the cockroaches out then he can look anywhere he needs. whether it starts with democrats' heads rolling or republicans, i do not care a fig, as long as it is done.Wish more people understood this. I hate party allegiances because nobody cares when their party gets caught in the dirt but will never shut up when the other does. Why don't we all want to condemn the bad apples?Yeah, the "party over country" thing has gotten really fucking old. While republicans have taken it to fun new extremes over the past year or so, Democrats are certainly not innocent. If Podesta or anyone else involved with the Dems is involved with shady shit, put them in prison. Good fucking riddance. "John Podesta is not currently affiliated with the Podesta Group and is not part of Mueller's investigation."The only thing more corrupt than a Republican is a Democrat.  Or maybe I have that backwards...Give it a few more elections and I'm sure it will cycle back, or maybe the other way...Can I just register as "American"?Yes.  No party affiliationIt seems like neither party registers as American these days.This is partly why I am no longer registered Democrat. Not only do I share beliefs and values from both sides of the aisle - I can’t be boxed into one party of the other - I also don’t swear allegiance to a candidate solely because they have a (D) next to their name. A rat is a rat no matter what kind of wig you put on it, and I agree with the sentiment of flushing out all the roaches regardless of party affiliation. I'm only registered Democrat so I can vote in closed primaries for the candidate that's trying to push progressive policies and steer the party in the direction I like.I'm hardly "blindly voting for the person with a (D) next to their name", but when one candidate's platform focuses on cutting social welfare programs to give more money to people who already have it, I don't really feel like I have much of a choice.This might reference to people who vote down party lines without even a glance or knowledge of who they are voting for.To be fair, a person's choice whether to run as a Democrat or as a Republican tells you a lot about what they're likely to do in office.  Exactly. My #1 and #2 issues are the environment and labor rights, the party platforms make my choice very clear.Yes exactly - I can be non-partisan and still be particularly oppositional to basically all Republicans. Have you ever heard of a race at any significant level of government where the Republican candidate wasn't objectively less progressive than the other candidate/s? I can think of a few times where the Democrat was particularly dodgy and a particularly wholesome Republican represented a welcome breath of fresh air, but that's about it. Good on you. I wish more people were like this. Honestly I believe most people want mostly the same things but the political game is to polarize us as much as possible to divide us instead of letting us unite on universally agreed upon issues. People care less about corruption than they do witch hunting people who voted differently.We need to change our political structure to emphasize collaboration, rather than confrontation. To this end, a system that supports multiple viable parties (perhaps five to seven) would help to build effective coalitions and power-sharing, without becoming too fractious. It would allow people to have real choices in who they support, without getting lumped into a big tent. It would force parties to actually compete for votes.That's your right as an American. It shows you're open-minded. I don't understand why people choose parties like sports teams. *spellingBlind party allegiances have led to people being just complete, and I mean complete sheep.Like, you as a person support a particular policy or stance.  But if it comes from a guy from the wrong party you are against it, but if your guy says the exact same thing, you'll be for it.that is why the republicans have not sorted out trump yet, it does not matter as long as they are *holding the nintendo controller* for the next 4 years.childish, yet old and grey.. there's a joke in there somewhere.This is one of the biggest reasons I left the Republican party a long time ago. They were so focused on what Democrats were doing yet never holding their own people accountable. I'm sorry, of course Democrats are going to do things you don't like, they are the other party. You can't do anything about them. Make your party and representatives be held accountable for their own actions and lead by example, don't point fingers across the aisle and ignore it when you get caught doing the same thing. Being embarrassed by them has honestly really opened up my perspective and made me more liberal&gt; There is a ton of dark money in the system and we can't keep saying, "I know - whatcha gonna do?" It's graft.And people entrenching themselves into positions that can't be let go.Take a look at the votes for campaign finance reform bills in Congress. They are publicly available. I won't tell you what conclusions to draw, it'll be pretty damn obvious. Draining the swamp will only begin to happen if we overturn the [Citizens United decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC) and entirely outlaw Super PACs. I'd also personally like to see political contributions by businesses capped at the same limit as individual contributions.This is probably the single most important bit of legislation to change our political system for the better. From this change, a ripple of positive effects could potentially ensue.Edit: meaning, overturning the Citizens United decision and enacting true campaign finance reform. For real this time.It made zero difference in this last election where Hillary far outspent Trump.  Money doesn’t buy votes, it buys advertising.  When each side puts forth their worst product someone has to win despite the money spent. throwing money at a candidate doesn't necessarily mean they'll win, but it sure doesn't hurt their chances. Plus, if they DO win, you now have a president that you heavily supported, who is now somewhat indebted to you.  Money in general just plays way too big a part in US politics.  I'm not saying the whole 'you scratch my back, you become a well paid consultant for me after you're done' kind of politics don't happen elsewhere, but the amount of straight up capital involved in US politics is unparalleled.I think what you're saying applies more to something like a national presidential campaign.  Throwing money at local or even state elections has a huge impact.  It's this outside money that has bled into extreme views.  Vote for our BS or we'll primary you.Wolf PAC!I'd argue this doesn't go nearly far enough. Citizens United expanded the boundaries of money in politics, but the basic principle of it-and the resulting emphasis on fundraising and corruption-go back to 1976's *Buckley v. Valeo." Any effort to overturn the decisions made in *Citizens United* must change the basic principles which led to that decision. Pedantics, really. I totally agree with you. You get justice! You get justice! EVERYONE GETS JUSTICE!Hey Oprah, thank you.I hope he finds dirt on both sides. The lower the chance of someone screaming partisanship the better. I just hope he finds dirt where there is dirt. I don't care about sides. And I don't want him to feel like he needs to balance some sort of political ledger in this investigation. As was already stated, let the chips fall where they may.Chances are there is dirt everywhere.exactly. I don't care if its DNC or GOP. Muller needs to gut ALL OF THEM.Though, I would like to point out that this guy is a lobbyist.  He's not even on the DNC.  Good.  Anyone involved needs to be held accountable.Good. Justice should be bipartisan.Edit: Yeah, yeah, I should have said "nonpartisan" Or *nonpartisan*, even.I prefer non-parmesian.Gene Parmesan.*Squeals in delight*I knew it!r/unexpectedarresteddevelopmentHe will still bless you with the touch of His noodly appendage.Heathen...I'd settle for *"I can't believe it's not partisan"*Agreed. I’m fairly liberal but I don’t care if this investigation takes down some Democrats as well. Much rather find out the truth and have the guilty punished. Too bad the GOP doesn’t seem to feel the same way.I’m liberal but honestly I just want corrupt people out. If that’s liberals, so be it. People who are corrupt don’t belong to any party because they’re by themselves &gt; If that’s liberals, so be it.That's definitely a fair number of liberals, corruption in politics is not unique to any side. Regardless how a person aligns, if they can't admit this, I don't consider their opinion credible nor worthy of respect.The problem here is that lots of people equate the reasonable statement:*All political organizations are vulnerable to corruption and dishonesty*with the dangerous but similar-sounding statement:*Both major parties are equally corrupt and dishonest.*The former statement correctly identifies the importance of investigating and holding accountable all politicians, parties, and organizations. Voters should just as pissed--if not more so--when their own party members engage in corrupt or ineffective behavior. It's not only ethically wrong, but damaging to their political objectives.The latter statement leads to a mentality where corruption is a foregone conclusion that cannot be fought. Voters feel they should not bother to assess which candidates or party are more transparent and honest and vote accordingly. Minor scandals on one side get exaggerated to create false equivalences with major scandals on the other side, thus fitting the "both sides" narrative. Obstructionism and uncritical conservatism thrive, since "government" has been tarnished in the abstract as an inherently ineffective and corrupt way to solve problems, and the very politicians who contributed to this negative reputation can then turn around and profit by nominally promising to "reduce the size of government." It's dangerous and it's a key reason why US politics has devolved so much since Watergate.A similar thing is going with media.The true statement “No media source is totally free of bias and never makes mistakes”, gets conflated with “All media sources are equally biased”, which, no, isn’t true. The New York Times is not as biased as Breitbart. NPR is a more reliable source of information than InfoWars. But these false comparisons keep getting drawn.In a way it’s a lot more insidious than proclaiming your side has a monopoly on absolute truth. True believers believe in something after all, and you can maybe shatter that belief for at least some when it’s proven not to be true. Cynics can hardly be disappointed when something turns out to be a lie* *^Paraphrasing ^someone ^here^, ^can't ^for ^the ^life ^of ^me ^remember ^who ^though^.It also assumes that all biases are bad. Virtually every news organization in the US has a bias towards American news because they are American news organizations. That doesn't mean they are not credible at all. Being able to understand the potential biases of an organization and then critically evaluate what they are saying is extremely important.A simple and profound analysis!As a liberal, I *hope* this investigation takes down a few democrats. First, because I believe there’s corruption on both sides. Second, because it will go a long way towards getting conservatives to accept the findings. If it takes down more than one they'll start the lock her up chants again.If "she" is a part of it, sure. Lock up everyone involved.Top comments in this thread seem to be liberals saying "good: justice is more important than party". That's reassuring to see. I am honestly curious if there are any similar threads in the reverse? That is, republicans supporting Mueller as he digs into republicans and Trump associates?I would actually be happier to know that both sides have a strong ethical streak that is more important than party affiliation. However I have a hard time believing this based on what I've seen. It seems liberals are more likely to put ethics above politics, and republicans less likely to do so. But I'd love to be proven wrong. Someone please make me less partisan...No, but the fact the Mueller is willing to go after Dems should lend more legitimacy to his final conclusions.Mueller is a Republican who was director of the FBI and appointed by George W Bush. Why would he not "go after Dems"?I think most people are saying “fine as long as justice is done” because they’re assuming Mueller will find dirt on Trump. If the ultimate conclusion is “actually, Trump is off the hook but here are five Democrats who should be arrested” then I think you might see that attitude change. I don't think your hardcore trumpers would ever believe Trump to be guilty of ANYTHING no matter the evidence... that being said your Wall Street Journal reading republicans aren't so blinded and tend to be more likely to be critical... so in the event of solid evidence against him I can't imagine them supporting the president.I live in NW Louisiana, which is full of hardcore Trumpers. Many have grown tired of his antics. There’s definitely a softening in support, though it’s more to do with character than policy.I sat next to some guys at a restaurant last week. They were very Southern and very conservative, but they were griping about his meddling with the NFL, saying stuff like, “Kaepernick has the same rights as anyone else. I don’t like it, but it ain’t the President’s job to waste his time talking about it.”Huh, guys at the smokepit here in GA were talking about ways to drop NFL kneelers into Afghanistan to teach them a lesson about freedumb.  Well, yeah. There is going to be a very vocal element.But I’ve watched his support go from incredibly strong to moderate over the past half year among many (not even close to all) supporters.I’m interested in seeing what differences are made in the next three years.nonpartisan.  Justice should be nonpartisan.The FCB KGB , and the Russians are not republicans.  They are only about disrupting democracy and that doesn't mean they will try to infiltrate one party. I am not going to lie, it pisses me off that this is a partisan issue at all.  I don’t care if you are a democrat or a republican, if you fucked with the 2016 election, I hope Mueller gets you.  Tony Podesta is not the Hilary Clinton campaign Podesta. That's Tony's brother John Podesta, who is not part of this investigation. (Just trying to keep people from getting confused, since the article doesn't explain this until the 8th paragraph.)There are a lot of people conflating the two in the comments here. Conspiracy theorists hold to the principle that merely meeting someone once makes you complicit in their actions, being brothers might as well make them the same person using that logic.Except Tony and John do work very closely. Right. Podesta Group was founded in 1988 by Tony and John.And Tony is a lobbyist, and John is a chief strategist for the democratic front runners of the last 30 years. Not hard to connect those dots. Then there's Ron Podesta. AKA "Ronny the Pod" AKA "RonRon"Ron runs a deli in New Jersey. Never took a liking to politics, but he enjoys woodworking and plays in a keeper fantasy baseball league that dates back to the Clinton administration.&gt; dates back to the Clinton administrationAnd are we really supposed to believe that's just a coincidence?? Everyone knows his brothers pulled some strings to get him A-Rod.Well that sucks for him then.Thank you. I didn't know.well that was not clear at first glance.  thanks for letting me know.sadly, i'd still bet /r/conspiracy and the like will still look at this and say "i knew those podesta emails contained some dirt".Actually they have already accused Tony Podesta of being more involved in those Pizza gate theories than his brother, IIRC. I would think they would be happy to hear he's being investigated. Good. Burn out all of the corruption. Justice should not be dispensed along party lines.One might say we should *drain the swamp*So when Mueller starts investigating a Dem, T_D trolls consider it totally valid, but when he investigates 200 different GOP members, he's wasting his time, huh? Not saying Podesta shouldn't be investigated, I trust Mueller to find everyone involved and take them all down. I just think it's hysterical that once he looks towards the Dems, T_D morons *somehow* try to claim that it's all part of Trump's plan to "drain the swamp".I think it's important to remind ourselves that T_D no longer represents even the illusion of meaningful discourse. It is a troll sub full of people who either want to watch the world burn because they're privileged enough not to suffer, or people who are being paid to deliberately spread propaganda and misinformation.Well also it never represented that. T_D started as a 4chan meme sub.Eventually all the ironic meme supporters were pushed out by actual supporters.And /pol/ started as a meme board as libertarians pretending to be authoritarians to make fun of them, but it went quickly went [full Descartes](https://i.imgur.com/GlwIMKH.jpg).Yep, that does seem to be what's happening.  Lots of "finally found the democrats behind it all, we knew this would come out, ultimately vindicating our glorious leader. Nevermind that we've been saying the whole investigation was huge sham this whole time and that trump should have fired Mueller months ago".Zero intellectual honesty out of that lot.  I say investigate whatever needs to be investigated.  It's not proof of anything until evidence is brought forward and taken into a court. Good. I hope he takes down as many corrupt assholes as possible.Yes, but.... WHEN WILL HE BEGIN TAKING PEOPLE DOWN? I want him to investigate for the rest of his life and root out every corrupt asshole, but for the love of whatever sanity remains in this country, he needs to get people out of the White House and into prisons pronto.I feel like I am Martin Sheen in the *Departed*, not really knowing what's going on here, but building cases takes time. You know this.I just hope that "something isn't right" or whatever**The probe of Podesta and his Democratic-leaning lobbying firm grew out of Mueller's inquiry into the finances of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, according to the sources.** As special counsel, Mueller has been tasked with investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.**Manafort had organized a public relations campaign for a non-profit called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine (ECMU). Podesta's company was one of many firms that worked on the campaign, which promoted Ukraine's image in the West.**_____The bolded part is what you should take notice of as to why the brother And Podesta Group are being investigated.Not sure why Trump needed a distraction from this. That shit that happened yesterday with Browder getting his "visa" to the US revoked is more disturbing and at the same time Russia puts his on Interpol's most wanted list via a loophole. (The VP of Interpol elected last year is also Russian btw). Wonder if any Senators will bring it up today.&gt;The Podesta Group filed a FARA registration for its work with ECMU **only after the payments were reported by the media**. Manafort's firm also filed a FARA registration after media reports in June disclosed its work in Ukraine from 2012 through 2014.That part's got a pretty bad smell to it, methinks.  Looks similar to one of the many, many, many things that got Manafort in trouble.  We're still the allegation and investigation stage, but boy oh boy does it look like this Russia thing has deep tentacles into American society.  Who knows, maybe having a Democrat-leaning outfit implicated in all this will finally be what it takes for the nation to sit up and take notice.&gt; Not sure why Trump needed a distraction from this.    Probably because it's a lot harder to paint Mueller's investigation as partisan fake news when he's investigating dirty money on both sides of the aisle. This is the worst possible optics for Trumps "Mueller is a partisan hack" spin job.The article also doesn’t mention whether any of the other 5 firms that were hired are also under similar investigations. Podesta’s is the big name that people recognize, but it is also possible that some of the other firms didn’t file FARA either. I’m all for better enforcement of these laws regarding interaction with foreign nations in light of the recent events. Still, I don’t think anyone can point to this as equivalent to the totality of the claims against Manafort. great. take them all down.Mueller has the best job ever.Flexible hours, makes up his own schedule, hires who he wants, investigates who he wants, appears to be trolling DC by investigating both parties and when he's done will get a seven-figure book contract. and hey. ten years from now he can get a CBS made for tv movie special. Ten years from now he can get a ~~CBS made for tv movie special~~ award-winning 10-part Ken Burn's documentary on Netflix.Let’s hope for hbo, Cinemax or Netflix. we wanna see the pee tape re-enactment in its R rated glory. "Makes his own schedule" when you're leading a federal investigation amongst obviously guilty people and picking up everyone along the way, investigating claims f international conspiracy in a day and age where Alex Jones types are screaming for you to look in all the wrong areas is kind of just like "so do I want to get sleep Monday or Wednesday?"the chad investigatorI don't know about that. Imagine all the dirty dealings he's suddenly privy to? That would cause me to lose both my faith in western politics and my lunch.whoa, somebody has faith in western politics?Wide net getting wider son!  Purge the corrupt.As a Democrat, I say good. Country over party. I hope tons of criminals go to prison over this.I’m a republican. No matter how this turns out, it seems like Murller is being thorough and I like that. If our guy is bad, lock him up. If the other guys are bad, lock them up. I'm a Democrat, but I agree wholeheartedly.   There's too much corruption &amp; b.s. on both sides.Do you think one arrest would put enough fear into everyone else to help? This is something I’ve been pondering.One arrest is enough to tame the public's thirst for justice (Like that one banker arrested during the financial crash). Not good enough I say.I tend to vote Democrat and I find the "our guy/their guy" mentality to be a really shitty way to approach politics. Eventually, Mueller's trail will lead to......**HIMSELF***coming to theaters this summer,**Robert Mueller in***THE INVESTIGATION**Rob Schneider was a woman. Then he was an animal. Now he's about to become...Bob Muller!!Rated PG-13Now I'm picturing Rob Schneider like fifteen years from now playing Bob Mueller completely straight in a political docudrama and winning an oscar. That might end up being the biggest twist to come out of this whole thing  Ok, *now* his investigation is Real News. But only this part.*Boy, what Weinstein did was utterly despicable.**But just him.  Only him.*Bill Clinton is a real creep. But just him. Only him.It was so predictable that this would hit the front page of Fox News, which has never missed the opportunity to call into question Mueller's intentions, conflicts of interest, Hillary bias, etc, etc. Of course the irony will be completely lost on their readers.T_D saw this story a while ago.  They took it as a sign that Mueller may be actually investigating Dems and not Trump.  They have no ability to conceive that he could be going after both.  They see everything as 2 sides and you have to be on one or the other.Mueller isn't going after either.  He's going after Russia, and he's taking down everyone associated.  That may happen to include Trump and Tony P., but the endgame here is Russia.if Trump gets convicted, then its back to fake news"94% upvoted"Good. This shows that a lot of redditors want fairness and truth to come out of the investigation, and not just for Mueller to investigate one "side" of the aisle. Country before party. Let's see what happens in the future with the investigation.Yeah.  Democrats are fine with Mueller investigating Democrats because they believe in country over party.  Let justice be carried out.  But I've noticed that when Mueller investigates Republicans (as he has for months), Republicans do everything they can to deny it and discredit Mueller (as they have for months).  Because they demonstrably do not put country above party.The investigation is spreading out so broadly there's no telling who is going to end up caught in the net.Plot twist: Bernie Sanders is the evil mastermind behind all of this, playing Putin, Clinton and Trump.  His motive? (((Globalism)))."If only, if only" the woodpecker sighs,"the bark on the tree was as soft as the skies.That's quite a reference, Madame Zeroni.One day you carry Madame Zeroni up the mountain!r/unexpectedholesI'm gonna keep that link blue, thanks. I expect this subreddit to be full of sploosh.&gt; Bernie Sanders is the evil mastermindThen we find out he has a secret laboratory underground in upper Michigan with explosive lemons.The dossier says that Russian agents sought to push Bernie supporters to vote against clinton.  Not necessarily work WITH him.  Smart devils.I mean...Tad Devine's last job before taking on Sanders in 2015/16 was working with Manafort for Yanukovich in Ukraine. Just saying. Yes, he worked for longtime Dems before that, but he could have been flipped. That likelihood is extremely slim, though. But if 2016/17 has taught us anything...... it's that nothing is getting any slimmer.The funniest part is that this article just puts Manafort in even deeper shit, which I didn't even think was possible.Good. Corruption is not a partisan problem. I'd love it if this investigation clears out that upper-middle tier of shady lobbyist fucks on both sides.I mean, it would be great if it cleared out the top tier, but those guys are probably too smart to get caught. As a democrat I say, so be it. Let the chips fall were they may. R’s don’t hold the monopoly on sliminess. If there’s D’s with dirt on them, they should go down too.There plenty of bad people on both sides of the aisle. As a progressive, rooting out corruption is necessary for our democracy to function, equally as it needs to be accurately informed, and constantly striving to be informed. If this investigation shows that both major parties in the US had some hand in a Russian Cookie Jar, then I think that would show more fidelity to Mueller's findings. I'd rather our government represent us, all of us, then for this investigation to be a partisan circus. And to be honest, this investigation is already like a Matryoshka doll. What is another layer of corruption if it happens to be center-left leaning, as opposed to far-right?Hopefully the wrongs against the nation are exposed on both sides and we can become Americans. Our tribalism is dangerous to our nation. Hopefully we will become “We the people”..at the end of all this. So T_D and r/conspiracy are about to lose their collective shit today?They called it a distraction tactic and said nothing will come of it."We're not falling for your appeasement politics"EDIT: No need to downvote. Quote taken straight from their sub:&gt; We know how this works. This is the Comey play. Mueller is only leaking this to give illusion that his biased ass team of Clinton donors is "unbiased" and "fair."&gt; This is a vehicle to clear the Pedostas in the end, keeping the Clintons safe from the gallows they richly deserve.They don't believe a thing.christ that is some strenuous rationalizing right there&gt; christ that is some strenuous rationalizing right thereRemember, you're talking about the sub that advertised for the Unite The Right rally, but are definitely not white supremacists. You're talking about the sub that wants all Muslims deported, but aren't xenophobic or racist.There is no rational thought that occurs in that sub."Mueller finds it was Hillary who colluded and is being arrested at this very moment"t_d: FAKE NEWS!!! DISTRACTION! TRUMP ACTUALLY COLLUDED!The old duck season/rabbit season switcheroo. &gt;PedostaI love T_D. This is hilarious./r/conspiracy has to be real pissed that this made the top of /r/news - they were probably all ready to do another anti-reddit circlejerk (on reddit) because they don’t understand the difference between news and politicsI mean, [this same story was also submitted](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/788jqo/mueller_now_investigating_democratic_lobbyist/) to /r/politics. It's currently at 92% upvoted.Top comment and its top response:&gt;As a registered Democrat....I am completely comfortable with all of this. I don't care it it's republicans, democrats, independents....whatever. Get rid of all of the garbage wrapped up in this. Fuck em all.&gt;100% agreed. Mueller can investigate whoever he deems pertinent to this matter. I'll accept whichever outcome he arrives at, regardless of who it does or doesn't involve.Second top comment and its top response:&gt;If he was involved - take him down, Bob. That's the difference between the two "sides." &gt;Exactly. I want scorched earth, Democrats or Republicans. Throw them all in jail. And so on and so forth.Interestingly, it was submitted by a t_d, conspiracy, and HillaryForPrison poster for presumably the same reasons you mentioned.Yes. This absolutely can't mean anything to them other than SATANIC PEDO PIZZA is real and confirmed.How long until this turns into **_Mueller Officially Investigating Pizzagate!!!_**Who am I kidding, it probably already has.Pretty sure that was the narrative a few weeks backI'm a Dem, but if he's corrupt, fuck him too. Everyone who is tainted needs to go down regardless of party affiliation Seems obvious to me that to fix this country we need to get rid of the lobbies.  All structures should be with a Front Door going straight into the main office.Too much fuckery happening in those lobbies.I was taught a long time ago in business that if you want a answer for why something is done a certain way, follow the money trail. Taco bell using so much purple on their buildings and advertising in the last ten years? They bought a company that was failing and had a sh*t ton of purple paint, enough to do 90% of their USA franchise remodels.As a Democrat: GOOD!Just because Trump is a diabolical maniac doesn't mean I don't give a shit if Democrats are working with Russia and peddling influence. Get everybody who did it outta there.Who’s got popcorn?Butter or kettle corn? Either way, I've got like five boxes of Buncha Crunch I can bring over too.Good. Flush em all out.ITT: People who think liberals are against Podesta being punished just because conservatives are against Trump being punished.I'm liberal and I'm cool with anyone who's a crook getting caught in the net. There's so many bottom feeders at the highest levels of our government it's mind-boggling. Being a douche isn't a partisan thing.I am interested to see if places like Fox News, etc, will suddenly see the Mueller investigation as more meaningful and legitimate thanks to this. I predict they will. Edit: Ah, there it is.https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/922528049622605827They will see it as meaningful and legitimate *only in regards to Podesta* and still call it Fake News™ for the dozens of Republicans implicated. They will be entirely shameless in this. Their hypocrisy knows no bounds.When their ideology is based on projecting your own flaws on others, no  wonder the trolls are out in masses today.Also, people not knowing Podesta's first name.Reminder that this isn't John Podesta.Honestly, this is good for most Democrats. If Mueller's findings result in takedowns on both sides of the aisle, it won't look like some sort of Republican witch hunt, which it's not. The DNC needs a good shakeup, anyway, and if there were D's that were complicit, they don't deserve to stay in power. As a true American I say, Mueller, bring the whole turd down. I don’t care if they have a D, an R, or an I next to their name. Whoever has any hand in selling out our democratic ideals has to go. Enough is enough. I wish this were a simple understanding that the whole country could rally around, maybe it will happen, it just needs to happen before we do too much damage. I like Mr. Mueller more and more each day, he should take them all down no matter political affiliation. DC is by far filthiest fucking place on planet!!!Trumpkins yesterday: "This investigation is a sham. A witch hunt. All of these through threads and interviews are nonsense."Trumpkins today: "This is proof that Podesta is a criminal."If there are people in the Democrat party who broke the law, as a Democrat, I want them punished EVEN WORSE than I want Republicans punished. Get the fucking scum out of my party! THEN get the goddamn corrupt Republican traitors.As a lifelong liberal &amp; most of the time democrat... it's about time.Does anyone actually expect these rich tyrants to face accountability? We have seen time and time again the US Justice System refuse to prosecute (let alone indict) rich individuals or organizations, even if they have committed high crimes, e.g. funding terrorism, money laundering, massive fraud, etc.Why would this be any different?So does this mean it's not a partisan witchhunt, guys?PSA this isn't John Podesta.Can someone help me understand something: Why would Manafort be pro Russia if he was lobbying for Ukraine to become part of the EU?He sounds like a pure mercenary He's pro-whoever is paying him the mostI hope he brings down the hammer on anyone guilty of corruption , regardless of party. This is perfect honestly. Get all the corruptness out of Washington, but also if people on the right try to use this as a talking point, it only validates Meullers investigation as a whole. Win Win.Let's stop the Democrat vs Republican thing and actually drain the swamp. Both sides are poisoned with corruption.As well they should, Podesta Group took a lot of money to lobby for Ukrainian groups and has a lot of ties to Manafort overseas.Please note that Tony Podesta and John Podesta are different people  and John Podesta does not appear to directly work for Podesta Group anymore.  Podesta Group and Tony Podesta did not work for Hillary's campaign, either.  Clinton campaign does not appear to be under investigation.   Undoubtedly, though, John Podesta should be probed in the investigation considering he founded Podesta Group and Tony is his brotherRight-wingers: "WTF I love Mueller now"Corruption is corruption. If he is doing something wrong take him down. It’s good to see all the liberals in the thread standing up for justice in the investigation regardless of their party! Corruption is not a partisan issue.Sounds like this is part of the Manafort investigstion.Good.Get everyone involved in that shit. Time for conservatives to love mueller again Damn Robert works fastGood. Clear these fuckers out, they're undermining our party.Ironically, and through a painful series of otherwise avoidable chain reactions, Donnie T. may actually end up draining at least the far corner of the shallow end of the swamp. I mean it will be accidental on his part, but I'm all about seeing lobbyists who are operating illegally get cleaned out of the system. Too bad the deep end of the swamp is just getting deeper. He's basically strip mining in the thing at this point.Hey root out corruption wherever it may be.Fine by me. Get all the crooks.This is good. It shows no bias and indicates a thorough investigation. Am I wrong?Good let's remove corruption where ever it sits.Get the guilty ones. All of them. And now trumpists will suddenly like Mueller.
Many police cars have laptops mounted near the dash, and cops have to look at them while driving.  It's at least as distracting as texting while driving.  Which is why police and others are typically specifically made exempt from these laws.If I am to understood the science it is that actively texting while driving is worse than drunk driving to a certain point ? You’re literally not looking at the road. He’s talking on his radio, browsing FB Criminal Minds Edition, eyeball fucking you, I would say at that point it is at least as dangerous as texting while driving and if so is worse than drunk driving. Is a cop allowed to drink and drive now ?? This is madness. &gt; If I am to understood the scienceAlways a great start to a rage comment. Give BlackPortland a break.  Perhaps he was distracted while trying to type out his comment by another driver who was also texting while driving.I hate when I see someone texting and driving. I always speed up and throw my beer at themTh gamar is on poontBut it be spelling error you maked...I get that it's a dick move to be a grammar nazi, but how hard is it to just reread a comment before you post to make sure it at least sounds right and isn't just babble? Oh you fuck grammar is the dick and maybe shut fuck and then go into maybe then to be the whole check under the batfuck insane clown.Nope, not that hard.I spits out my covfefe when I red you comment.Get back to Twitter Mr. President. Or at least stay on /r/pyongyangBut, one never knows. He could be writing this while driving and has no time for editing.I don’t recall the comedian, but my favorite quote on this is: “If you’re drinking and driving, at least *someone* is driving the car. When you text and drive, *no one* is driving the car!”Marc Maron!The answer is yes, cops are allowed to drink and drive.  Not on the job, but at least in the small town I live in they all know each other and none of them are arresting one another for drunk driving despite claiming to be champions against drunk driving and heroes every time they make an arrest of the poor bastard whose license plate light is out and had 2 and a half beers after workI've attended the wedding of a police officer. The vast majority of people who were there were either police or people who worked at police departments in the area. When the wedding was over I saw dozens and dozens of blatantly drunk cops driving out of that parking lot like it was nothing. It was both eye opening and terrifying.I worked in NJ for a while and drank with cops and prosecutors about once a week. They'd make sure I only had a couple, "because you don't get courtesy like we do." Then they'd drink several.Chicago checking in, I knew cops who drank and drove there.no joke when i used to work the drive thru at wendys, i had a cop come by at about 1am drinking a beer. i shit you not his exact words were "its alright im a cop"I'd tell him- "It's alright, you're not getting your fucking burger""Is a cop allowed to ___" is always followed by a yes in the USA. Except testify against a cop. That will get you shunned for a little while, at least until the others can arrange an accident. "...be an honest person with integrity and professionalism and compassion."That's a definite no.Well no, once you take a one week course all that risk goes away.Actually there are cops that do drink and drive. And not just the ones who get caught while off duty. A few years go, quick example, plain clothes detectives pulled over in front of someone's house, threw out a bunch of Heineken bottles and took a piss. Broad daylight. Homeowner was looking right at them like "....really?". For every great cop that's good at police work, you'll have 4 or 5 douchebags who signed up for the gun, power, get out of jail free card, or all of the above.Bunk and McNulty at their old tricks again...like david bisard. a real piece of shit. he was allowed to get caught for multiple duis and crash 2 cruisers. but nothing was done until he killed some motorcyclists. 80 to 86 percent of cops are bad apples???Bro, there's a lot of bad apples but saying nearly every cop is bad just makes you look like a nut case.Edit: went from 9 upvotes to 1 upvote... not sure if I pissed off The_d for saying there's a lot of bad cops or Antifa for saying there's a lot of good cops.Edit 2: -5 now (5 mins from my last post)... All cops are bad? No cops are bad? Tell me what you want to say and I'll say it to stop the downvotes!!!they probably don't consider themselves bad apples, they just dont pay attention to certain laws that they deem unnecessary at the time. "The only moral law breaking is my law breaking"I wish that worked for the average citizen- "Because my drug use has no effect on anyone but myself-  I'm not breaking any laws by getting high"All cops who protect bad cops are bad cops themselves by the transitive property.A -&gt; BB -&gt; CThus A -&gt; C, wherein C is rampant Cuntery.^ This guy transitives. The saying is, "one bad apple *spoils the bunch.*"So yea. 80% or so seems about right, especially in some places.God you cop apologists are the worstMaybe he lives in Missouri.Well, for every cop that does something terrible, 3 more are willing to lie about it. So it's not as far off as you would think.[And that's not even getting into the 1 out of 5 cops who take a stand](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ex-baltimore-labeled-rat-police-brutality-claim-article-1.2077632)Edit: Also the parent comment says "4 or 5", not four out of five.Wow.  The Police force is actually a legal mob organization.Well, they're more the protection and coercion arm of the bigger legal mob we call the government The parent comment said for every good cop, there are 4 or 5 bad cops. If it is 4 bad cops then 80 percent are bad. If it's 5 bad cops then 86 percent are bad.(At work so I'll check your link later).1 Bad apple spoils the bunch.they're all bad apples. because none of them arrest the actual bad ones.Paramedic who has same systems in car. Explain how we or police are going to do our job without communication? Impossible. As a paramedic I always have my partner with me. He drives and I deal with the computer, radio, and navigation Impossible. Because no one was a cop or paramedic before these systems I'm sure there have been no improvements to response time, coordination, and saving lives since then either.Nope, just cops being hypocrites and driving while distracted. Also cops never signal when turning from what I've seen, and I've seen few roll through stop signs. It's not the laptop's fault, cops are cops.lol, indeed we used the radio and paper+pencil. So much more efficient then a touchscreen that provides all the info+updates and directions.The simple answer is to operate in pairs. Here’s your tax hike for the same number of units in serviceHah! I saw 5 units responding to a traffic stop the other night. The officer who made the stop was in an unmarked Dodge Ram with special lights. Shortly after, two SUVs and two "crown vics" (they might have been Taurus', not sure) showed up and partially blocked a side street and an intersection. $450k in salaries hanging around, plus vehicles... for a single car traffic stop. I understand having units on duty, but 5 units for a traffic stop??The County I currently work in spans 475 square miles and has just two deputies working during nightside. They might get one person to back them up in an altercation or warrant service if they’re lucky.  As for us on the ambulance, we could wait 45 minutes to get LE assistance.So I get your point, but you and I see two pretty different systems.  If our deputies worked in pairs, we’d have one car on the road in a very large county.How does the ambulance get to the hospital if I'm in the back treating the patient? Ambulances always have 2 people for that reason While the second person is in the back taking care of the patient, the driver might have to look at or fiddle with the screenWhile i dont have the answer it is a bit 2 faced to speak about the evils of distracted driving and than install so much tech in the cab the user is bound to be distracted. If using your cellphone is that bad, a solution should be found to free up the cab for you guys so you arent distracted either. We are all humans. No need to be upset that we expect you to act like the rest of us do for the most part.Just another good reason for 2 person patrols and 2 person paramedic crews. Takes some lone wolf officer involved shootings off of the table as well, it's somewhat common for those shootings to occur because of a lack of backup.I am sure police would love two man crews. Officers do tend to like them, obviously it makes for a better day when you have a partner and you feel more safe. Those in charge of the budget don't tend to like them as much. Patrol routes are usually based on a number of cars that it will take to make that route work for average response time, so taking half of the cars off the street can present difficulties and generally more police overall are needed on the force. With people asking for body cams and additional training, as well as more 120 credit bachelors candidates (rightfully so I might add) additional officers doesn't seem to be in the budget. Which is a shame, I think that having 2 officers in every car as a requirement may cut down drastically on many other issues. It's a pretty simple solution. Work in two man teams. You got the driver then the guy who does everything else. Wow magic, but I guess you're right it's just impossible. I agree, it's not impossible. It's actually a great idea. But, like a lot of other great ideas, it does cost a lot of money. I encourage you to lobby your town/county/city council to require all emergency services to operate in two man teams. What are you doing on your screen while driving? I'm honestly curious because documentation should be done after the call, GPS should be locked in before rolling out, and incoming report is usually made by radio or phone. I can't think of anything your guy in the back can't handle while you're driving. No it's not at all impossible, you dont need to be looking at it while driving. With a partner.Which makes it totally safe. Atleast where I am from they need to be using it for work reasons in order to fall under the exemption. If he was browsing his personal FB he would still be violating the law. Wonder what the wording is there?&gt; Which is why police and others are typically specifically made exempt from these laws.They are made exempt because they have the pushy bar to get people out of there way when they drive distracted, no harm done to their cruiser!But aren't we all humans?The police do not get special training in texting/computer while driving. The legislators only make them exempt because police lobbyists promoted the exemption. So either the police texting/computer while driving is not dangerous. Or it is as dangerous. Either way, the legislators that voted for the law do not have the citizens' best interest at heart.Actually we do get special training in computer driving. During our EVOC course we had our computers open on "fake" calls with updates coming in as we drove. "Serve and protect" the law or above the law? Pick one. You aren’t above the law if the law explicitly exempts you.The law explicity exempting you makes you above itShould an ambulance, ever, under any circumstances, be allowed to drive through an intersection when they have a red light?I went on a ride along in high school and the police lady I was shadowing almost drove us into a mailbox because she was using that damn laptop. Way more dangerous than a phone because she literally would steer with her knees while not looking, and using both hands to use the laptop. There was a cop in California that drove up onto the sidewalk and killed a movie producer or writer or something and his excuse was he was typing in that computer. I'm pretty sure nothing happened to him. You're probably referencing [Milt Olin](http://miltolinfoundation.org). Olin was riding his bicycle when he was hit from behind by a Sheriff's deputy. The killer is still on the force.Meanwhile, in the next county over, the City of Westminster recognized the danger such distractions pose and retrofitted the communications technology in its patrol cars. (Unsurprisingly, the County of Los Angeles has not).Not to underscore the prevalence of distracted driving or anything, but... the head of Westminster's fleet department, who oversaw the retrofit, and his friend had been riding bicycles the year before when they were hit from behind by a distracted driver. The fleet guy spent several days in the ICU. His friend, the very recently retired former chief of the Westminster Police Department, was killed.Maybe, but I distinctly remember the victim being reported "jogging" so it's probably a *different* person killed by police in the same manner.  [deleted]I think you missed his point, he's not saying this cop was using his dash-mounted laptop. He's just saying that texting on your personal phone is probably similarly distracting as using their dash-mounted laptops. Still, why add unnecessary distractions to already existing ones? It will only have more probability of accidents, correct?Not sure man, I don't have a strong opinion on this one way or the other, was just stepping in to explain to the guy I replied to because he wasn't fully understanding the OP's comment. Oh..ok. sorry!Haha, no need to apologize, fellow Canadian ;) Which is bullshit. Apparently commoners can't do 2 things at once but you put on that badge and suddenly you are super human. A cop cross the center line in my city while on his laptop and had a head on collision with a kid in my highschool. Kid died. Cop still has his job is there a news story attached to that? You'd think that would have made the headlines.This was like 6 years ago east of mission between hope and mission kinda Are you referring to when Deputy Anthony Wood killed the former Napster COO back in 2013, when the officer was typing and replying to messages on his computer while driving?The officer was never charged with the crime, the prosecutors said that because the law allows officers to use technology while driving and they have permission to use technology, that they didn't think they could convict on a negligent homicide charge.   Somehow "permission to use technology to report in" equates to "permission to ignore all safety protocols and negligently kill people".  The published reason was they believed police union lawyers would make it difficult to fight, plus they didn't really feel like fighting one of their own for something as minor as manslaughter.  They also fought to release all evidence from the crime scene, calling it an internal investigation and since charges weren't filed it wasn't subject to records laws.As in most cases, there was a civil lawsuit from the family where the city settled the case without admitting to doing anything wrong.This is a word salad that I, for the life of me, can't decipher.Hope and Mission are two cities east of the Greater Vancouver Area in British Columbia.This would most likely have been an RCMP officer as they are the police of jurisdiction in those regions. I don't recall hearing about this either.At least. An entire set up ready to rock and roll with a much cooler version of Facebook. Hell yeah this is “at least as distracting as texting while driving.” Let’s not dispel this notion... CopRock and RollI'm not joking I've seen a cop with Facebook on his laptop while stopped at a light.  WTF how is that even an option?Yeah they are in most ambulances as well. If you are responding to a call your partner can navigate for you but if you are driving in a call you have to navigate yourself using the interactive map(if you aren't familiar with that part of town). I really wish we had turn by turn navigation. looking at a screen while driving is as distracting as looking at a screen AND Typing on it? I doubt it, shouldn't do either, but one is one and the other is two..They’re not supposed to use them while driving.  At least in NY.There are a lot of things they're not supposed to do.Ok but OP said they have to use them while driving.  They don’t.&gt; have toNahhhh. Cops did fine before computers.I had a trick for this.  When I needed to look at something I pulled over.  I've seen cops being a danger on the road doing things like sorting papers.  There's very little urgency to do these jobs while risking the safety of others.  Why do they have to? Can't they pull over? I get if it's an emergency, but what are they doing on their laptops while driving if there's an emergency?Looking at navigation, most likely. Most patrol cars use the computers, rather than a stand alone gps unit. At least that's the way it was a few years ago in most California precincts.Well that's no different from looking at a gps while driving then. Wait, is that something you're not supposed to do?In California? Yes and no. You can look at gps if its already set before driving, obviously. But you can't change it while driving unless it's hands free. Typing while driving is supposedly illegal. The law is pretty ambiguous, and there's been court challenges for technicalities, but ostensibly, non-hands-free cell phone use is outlawed in the state of CA while driving. No idea what's up in TX these days where this took place...they normally don't look or interact with it while driving, which is what they're supposed to do. Dispatchers are to verbally give out any new info to a call they're going to as we have to assume they don't look at the screenWhat kind of armorer allows shitty Tapco magazines or puts a folding vertical grip on a duty rifle? This is the real injustice here.On the upside at least he wasn't wearing black tac gear and combat boots straight out of a ChaeperThanDirt catalogue.I'm originally from the area. Whole lotta dumb down there.This is my favorite comment in this thread. It's bad enough he was texting, but driving from the back seat of the patrol unit is just ridiculous!The long arms of the law.https://youtu.be/YRJv0qU62YE?t=81I, too, had to read it twice before I understood.I didn't even understand until I read this, also this is the biggest non-story I've ever seen.&gt; The sheriff's office says they gave Glover [the arrestee] the option to file an official complaint, but he has yet to do so.Yeah. He wants to leave jail with his teeth in place. Gotta watch those slippery staircases.Why should he? They have evidence of a crime being committed, THEY should follow it up, not Glover.in most places it not a crime for a police officer to do this. They have laptops and radios so they were made exempt Because you know... cops are magic and texting while driving doesn't affect magical unicorn cops like the rest of us mere mortals...The numbers don't lie. Cops have been involved in millions, if not thousands of car accidents and have never been at fault.Doctors have to carry hefty insurance. Odd that it's not the same for our boys in blue.Exactly. I’ve never understood why not, except for maybe the fact that politics are government while doctors are privateYeah I mean I'd imagine tax payers would be getting screwed either way.But who pays for such insurance?The people.Edit: I just saw your other comment about who pays in the end.http://wjla.com/news/crime/cop-cruiser-crashes-you-pay-the-cost-when-local-police-cause-accidents-109196&gt;&gt;Colasanto fought in Richmond to change laws requiring police lights and sirens after being forced to watch her daughter’s life end on a dash camera. McIntosh was killed by a police cruiser that slammed into her car. The officer had run a red light at a high rate of speed without using a siren.I can't begin to imagine the amount of injustice and rage this woman had to get a handle on. Her daughter died needlessly and the police invoke immunity only to protect their own.Yes but... the distracted driving laws are pretty vague on the type of device I would much rather allow cops to be able to use their radios wile driving. But he should be reprimanded for textingRadios take almost no attention. You dont have to look at them.  You pick them up, contact dispatch, and then go where you have to.You're right, radios are fine. What's not fine is looking at a giant laptop screen instead of the road.Well, TIL. Interestingly though, I am allowed to use my amateur radio while driving too, but not a cell.It's just fucked since he's being held captive in the officer's car, he can't physically or legally do anything about the situation. Officer is risking his life and putting his prisoner's life on the line. Hooray! Police retaliation! "Laws for thee, but not for me!" - creed of the bullyLike how cops are allowed to lie to you.  But if you like to them you go to jail.  Although, you are allowed to remain silent. You only need to identify your true identity. You can reject answering any other question.but, you're still going for a ride to the station, and the rest of your day/night is pretty much doneDon't forget your your career prospects when you background check shows an arrest! &gt;But if you like to them you go to jail.Just don't click on the like button then.If you can make 'em, you can break 'em.Working the onboard computer is even more distracting. Just saying.Yeah.  Always see cops texting and driving.  But they are above the law so meh....Yep. I see them speed without lights or siren, change lanes and turn without indicating, fuck around on their phones or computers while on the highway, etc. Could you imagine calling one of them out on it?  You have a good chance of being arrested or even shot.  Totally not a criminal culture. /sI saw one reading a newspaper splayed across the steering wheel on a major road. How is a man under arrest able to pull out a phone and record anything? The arrestee should be cuffed, probably with his hands behind his back. Edit: reread the very short article and somehow missed where the officer allowed the man to be cuffed in front due to the arrestee's wrist hurting. Also, the officer was so distracted that he didn't noticed his suspect reaching into his pocket and pulling out a phone?! If he's this easily distracted, he's lucky the arrestee didn't have a weapon. Or even just drugs/evidence that he could have hidden in the car. Still should be searched. The way I've always seen it done is to search them and put all of their property into a separate bag that they can't access. Not sure why the cop gave it back. I agree. This officer messed up a couple different ways. You aren't always hand cuffed.   I have been in the back of the police 3 times, never with cuffs on.  You get patted down, and shoved in the back.  Now, admittedly mine was for stupid, non-violent things (trespassing for example.  Fun side note.... I owned the property, he didn't believe me).You don't keep a certified copy of your deed in your wallet? /sHonestly... You normally get a ticket and told to appear, I was mostly dragged in for contempt of cop.   The property was a mostly ruined warehouse in the middle of no where I bought for back taxes.   He bellowed at us that owner complained about people there, I said "did not" and it went south from there.   Needless to say, it got dropped really quick, the point was to inconvenience me.he lied to you and then arrested you? did you have the option to press charges against him?No of course not.  I got dragged down there, got a lecture on how they didn't need the owner to press charges to ticket me for trespass,and this was years ago, but I think there was a threat of breaking and entry and burglary too.   Anyway it got completely dropped.Seems like the beginning of a Month Python skitPretty much.  Rural town in upstate NY, what do you expect.I'd like to hear more about what you ended up doing with this warehouse. They will never again forget to strip those they arrest of all recording devices in the future.You're missing the point, folks.Cops are better than you./sThis literally happened to me 6 years ago, driving on the parkways racing back to my house. My grandfather had a heart attack I’m booking it on the phone he pulls me over I had 2 Vicodins not in my script bottle(my fault not arguing why I was arrested) proceeded to belittle me how could I text / call and drive.  This fucking cop was on his phone the entire time he was taking me back to the station.  In fucking real it’s almost comical at times.Apparently people don't know that cops and other emergency personnel and explicitly exempt from distracted driving laws. Wait until you learn the traffic laws they are exempt from tooIn Oregon, the police and other public servants are specifically excluded from the distracted driving law.Why? I'm genuinely curious, because it's not like they aren't susceptible to distraction.*something something public good*Cause sometimes you have to do stuff on the computer while you are going to a call.Cops are allowed to text and drive while on duty.Cops are allowed to do anything while on duty.  FTFY.Anyone want to take a crack at deciphering what he's typing?  The first word looks like it could be "noon".  (Or MOON...)Cute, they want to know if the guy filming wants to make a formal complaint. They have video proof of wrong doing. That would be enough to get any cop or police department to write a ticket for you or I. Now that it's a cop, they need someone to complain. Corruption sucks...Police are exempt from the cell phone ruleIt would be interesting to see data on police accidents caused by distractions. My guess an unusualpercentage are classified as  "brake failure".....I came here looking for a policeman driving from the back of the patrol unit, but it was just an ambiguous title...I was picked up a few weeks ago, wish i had a way to record him because the sheriff was texting the entire ride to jailIn an age where cops just blatantly murder unarmed people.  I really don't think anything will come of this. Do as I say, not as I do.1995 I was hit by a drunk cop, DOT reports showed he was doing over 100 mph when he hit my 1990 peterbilt, I was in hospital for 3 weeks and in physical therapy for a month. Almost died but the absolute best thing about that day is the cop burned to death (wish I could have seen that) and the city paid for my three grand kids college education. Some times it's good when cops break the law.So can the  arrestee sue on grounds of say, reckless endangerment?Also, I feel like the is an offense one should be fired for.Grounds for immediate termination No good deed goes unpunishedso many ppl drive like this. Makes me sick.So many people write like this. Makes me sick.me sick too. school no teach no more. sad time we no learn stuff good.How did he still have his phone?
For those trying to figure out which guy George Young was, he was their producer. You never saw him.And Angus and Malcolm's older brother!I guess I never really realized it, but AC/DC is pretty much a Young brothers project, huh?Yeah but The Young Brother's Project doesn't have quite the same dangerous vibe. The Young Brothers Project sounds like a 70s prog rock band.sounds like rejected early name for the Jackson 5Alternative name:  The Dadbeatsslowclap.jpggolfclap.jpgKind of filthy deeds done for not much money.It's a great distance to the peak, if you want to make music.Impacted by an athmospheric electric discharge.Whilst navigating the roadway to the netherworld. Large nutsack.I always thought AC/DC was meant to be a sexual ~~pun~~ reference.EDIT: Pun was the wrong word.It's actually a slang term for bisexual, at least in Australia in the 70s, they found out from a taxi driver after they started using the name, they were going to change it but they never did Edit: [here](https://youtu.be/lNLyQIi-Oc4?t=452) is the source of the claim in my post]I think the same could be said about their chord progression. Their chord progression is bisexual?And could use some changingIsn't it for alternating current / direct current?Yes, but it was also the slang as far as I know Yep.  That's what I remember hearing as a kid.Always heard it stood for “after Christ/Devil comes”. But a grew up in the south where rock n roll was the devil’s music.  And I had people swear it meant Anti-Christ\Devil's Children. Many supposed meanings have been floated.They probably tour with those Knights In Satan's Service!I always heard it was "Against Christ/Destroy Christ". Soooooo dumb.Might be thinking of DVDA.DVDA's best song is "Now you're a man!"&gt; DVDA.That's what you do when you can't get any other work.Jesus ChristNo thanks, I don't go to those kinds of parties anymore.They addresses that in an interview. None of them had any idea of the connotation before a cab driver IIRC mentioned it. It was supposed to be a shocking name, but not sexual at all. IIRC, Angus said they took it from the small consumer protection logo on a vacuum cleaner. I don't get it. What do you think the pun is?https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/785vuu/acdcs_george_young_dead_at_70/dorvquz/Their sister Margaret saw AC/DC on the back of a sewing machine and thought it looked cool. The boys agreed. Some thought it was a bisexual thing:  https://youtu.be/RXnjkFltSeA?t=7m14sWhat's the pun?https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/785vuu/acdcs_george_young_dead_at_70/dorvquz/Kings of Leon are another group that's 3 brothers and cousin.  ...true!..and The Beach Boys,as well!And Chevelle I think as wellAnd GojiraChevelle was three brothers. One quit/was fired (the bassist), because he didn't handle touring well. They fired him over Thanksgiving I forget what year.more of an old brothers project at this pointGet out of here, Dad!Thank YouHonestly I saw the title and registered "AC/DC, Young, dead" and thought the worst. Well, it's probably not going to be that long. He smokes like a trooper don't he?Some people are human chimneys and live to be 90+.Well, Angus is a Scottish-born Australian. If there's anybody belligerent enough to tell cancer to fuck off and have it work, I suppose it would be him. It’s the dementia that’ll get him.Malcom is the one with dementia.Which means Angus will likely develop it, too.IIRC Malcom's dementia is due to decades of alcoholism, and not genetic.and Angus is a teetotalerBut George is older than both of them and he made it to 70 without getting dementia (as far as we know, I guess), so specious reasoning there.FYI, just being named Angus adds an extra 8.4 years to average lifespan. Not if you're a cow.That's true. Not the majority, mind.Definitely, there is a bit of a survivorship bias. We don't see all the dead smokers walking around, but many of us know a local or family member who is 80+ and hasn't tasted clean air since they were 10.Harry Dean StantonMalcolm isn't doing too well these days either, he had to quit the band because he was suffering some kind of dementia.He also had lung cancerI thought he was treated for that pretty successfully, the reason he stopped touring was because he couldn't remember how to play the songs. He's in a nursing home now, as far as I've read.There's an army of people he inspired to pick up the guitar in the first place that will remember.You're correct, I was just adding that since the topic was about health issues, specifically noting how they smoke.That is horrible That could be related to the dementia.

While chemo brain can go away after cancer treatment, there are also likely long-term impacts  that show up when the brain starts aging.

After 40 years with one line-up change that wasn't caused by a death, now it's basically The Angus Young Band, or an ACDC cover band.(to go on a tangent...) Like Black Sabbath and the Rolling Stones, amazing early work is tainted by a group (or even a single member) who can't seem to let go and move on. I look at bands like that, and wonder; if say the Beatles or Led Zeppelin hadn't broken up, and had taken the route of the Stones or ACDC, would they still have he legendary staus they have? IMO, if the Stone broke up in the mid 70s, or ACDC and Sabbath broke up in the mid 80s, thier legacies would probably be stronger than they are now (not saying those groups didn't do anything good past those dates- but that was the end of thier hey-days, imo)  A big part of why Led Zeppelin (or celebs who die young like Hendrix, Morrison, Cobain, Winehouse etc Also Bon Scott) have such 'legendary' status is the "always leave people wanting more" factor, and bands like ACDC and the Rolling Stones have done the opposite of that.I disagree with some things, but I agree with others, which is which isn't important, thanks for your reply.Keith. Fucking. Richards.I firmly believe that Keith Richards died in the early 80's and was replaced by a Disney animatronic puppet. So his role in Pirates of the Caribbean was really just closing the karmic circle.He feeds off of the energy of other people. As long as there are other people in the world, Keith Richards will have a lifeforce to drain.[He watches what he eats.](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xf66od)Rumor has it he's a sentient pile of cocaine that retained his personality and memories."*Oh my god, no*--wait, which one?"In Australia anyway, George Young was better known as half of Vanda &amp; Young, influential songwriters/producers behind The Easybeats, and Stevie Wright, and other legends of Australian rock like Rose Tattoo and The Angels, and Flash in the Pan, as well as the AC/DC  connection.I don't know if the Easybeats (George Young was guitarist) are well known outside Australia- but they were an amazing band, imo. RIP George Younghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iW2_Ec3uEU[I happened onto ACDC's wikipedia a few weeks back- after a generally stable line-up (with afew changes- and ofc Bon's death) from '75 to 2015, over the last 2 years or so, *all* remaining members except Angus left (and now Axl Rose is the singer?).Kinda sad for such a legendary band, with such a long history- it's basically just The Angus Young Band now.]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AC/DC_band_members#TimelineAxl rose only sang lead vocals because Brian Johnson was having problems with his hearing. I think Brian is back as lead singer but I'm not sure as I dont think they've performed live since.Brian got his hearing aid sorted (I wouldn't call it a hearing aid but for the fact I've forgotten what it's ACTUALLY called) and has appeared on stage a few times. He was up on stage singing with Robert Plant and Paul Rodgers recently.If AC/DC can get Phil Rudds passport sorted out and Brian back in the band, I'd go see them.Rod Evans is looking ok, I wonder would Angus let him play bass again?I saw ACDC in Montréal just before Brian had to leave. The sound in the venue was kinda shitty so I'd definitely go see them again if it's Brian and it's at a different venue. Didn't know he was back :o. That's good shit. How are they even acdc after thatWas also in the Easybeats ('Friday On My Mind') and Flash and the Pan ('Hey St Peter', 'Down Among The Dead Men').Friday:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iW2_Ec3uEUHey St Peter:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgOMxTxWPuQDown Among The Dead Men:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myHmhpZkYOU&gt; You never saw him.And now it's going to be really hard to see him.Not just the producer of ACDC; He also produced Rose Tattoo's first album and The Angel's / Angel City's first album. Both albums are classics and mandatory listening if you like the sound of early ACDC. And for Australians, he's part of the Easybeats, a fantastic band and a really important part of Australian rock history. ~~Not true.  He covered for Malcolm in the 80s when Malcolm was in recovery.~~E: Never mind, it was Steve Young.I could be mistaken, but I think that was Steve Young.  He's Angus and Malcolm's nephew, although he's basically the same age as them.  He's also in the band (such as is it) now, since Malcolm stepped down.You're right, I'm wrong.Wasn't that his son, and in the 90s?Nephew, and in 1988."Oh, and by the way...which one's Pink?"That is like 110 in rock star years.Or like 11 in Keith Richard yearsNot to be flippant but I think [he's here young and happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iW2_Ec3uEU)[Good Times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNiY0siZY3Y) is the one that gets me.  One of the best choruses ever.At least the future scientists who study his body will have a good bass line to work from. Wait I had no idea he was in the band responsible for that song! Small world.Gene simmons is getting thereI'm still mourning Tom Petty.  And Dio, and he's been gone for years.  David Bowie.And it'll get worse:  Simmons.  Ozzy.  Rob Halford.  And plenty of others.  They're all up there in age. Still too Young. Founding member and rhythm guitarist of The Easybeats, which scored Australia's first #1 international pop hit with *Friday on My Mind* in 1966.EDIT: internationalTriple J played Sorry earlier, it was nice Fuck yeah the J's!I always assumed they were British and had no idea about the ACDC connection. That's pretty cool! In a way, they were. The Youngs were born in Scotland, and moved to Australia when George was a teenager.Australia has the greatest hits...Do you come from the land down under?Where women glow and men plunder?Can't you hear, can't you hear that thunder?You better run, you better take cover. He also co-wrote some classic songs with Harry Vanda, such as Stevie Wright's   epic 11-minute [Evie \(Parts 1, 2 &amp; 3\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In1VeSjsBT8) and John Paul Young's [Love Is In The Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNC0kIzM1Fo).Also producer/songwriter for OZ-Rock legends like Rose Tattoo, The Angels, Stevie Wright, Flash in the Pan, and pop acts like John Paul Youngand Ted Mulry Gang, and worked with INXS and Jimmy Barnes, Meatloaf and Judith Durham/The Seekers.As an aside- anyone remember that 80s Big M ad with Friday on my Mind, and the Porsche-driver?[E- found this one, but it wasn't the first in the series- IIRC that was a Porsche-driving snob in a turtle-neck, sneering "how quaint, an *Australian car*", at a guy in a Holden (HR Monaro?).]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py4lWm4jbUYAlso a member of a little known new wave band called Made And The Shade. Iirc he made the money they used to record the first few ACDC albums with those bands an then moved behind the recording console for his little brothers.That picture of Axl halfway down...not so flattering.There hasn't been a flattering pic of Axl since about '99.In 99 didn't he have those stupid dreadlocks?I think they were cornrows, but you are right that they were awful. The corn rows were a worse decision than getting rid of Slash, and Duffy. He's been ass ugly since the early 90s.If I had gold I would award it to you for that comment.!RedditSilver works!He looks a lot better now on the GNR tour. I saw him at the end of August and he's definitely lost some of that fat. And his vocals were the best they've been in probably 20 years.Agree he sounds pretty good as of late. His voice has seemingly recovered quite a bit. Maybe he finally quit treating himself like shit. I went to a concert a few months back just for shits and giggles and it was actually good. Would see another. Never thought I'd say that.I also saw GnR in August. It was a 3 hour show and Axel actually looked like he enjoyed being there. They all did. It's unfortunate that Izzy didn't sign on.Is he still a megadouche?Him and Slash are touring together and neither of them needed the cash, so there's a strong chance that he's getting over his shit, or managing his issues better.I hope so. I want to enjoy gnr again.I thought he sounded pretty rough(bad) when i saw them :/He looks like he's 68. He looks like another Young in that pic: NEIL YOUNG[removed]"Oh, oh oh OH Sweet Pie of Mine!"\* *Intro lead guitar* \*  \* *Rhythm guitar, bass &amp; drums join in* \*  ^^^^^^^^.I've got pies and it seems to me  I need hot wings with celery  And as much cake as I've got money to buy  ^^^^^^^^.Now I'm craving doughnuts with glaze  And tasty cakes to stuff into my face  And if I wait too long I'll prob'ly break down and cry  ^^^^^^^^.Oh, oh oh sweet pie of mine  Oh, ohh ohh sweet loaves of mine...  ^^^^^^^^.\* *Guitar lick* \*^^^^^^^^.I've got pies, creamy fruity pies  The cause of weight I've gained  I'd hate to have to give up pies  And get bad hunger pains  ^^^^^^^^.My fridge reminds me that I need some space  To keep butter that's fri-ied  And for those torrijas from Spain  And mille-feuille I buy-y!  ^^^^^^^^.Oh, oh oh sweet pie of mine  Oooh, ohh ohh sweet loaves of mine...

Also check out Grace Jones’ version of their Walking in The Rain. *Midnight Man* was my personal fave, but *Hey St. Peter* makes in onto sooo many new wave compilations. https://youtu.be/ev5odVRMs6kGeorge is dead. Malcolm has lost his mind. Angus is a walking lung cancer tumor. And Axl fucking rose is singing for them. At risk of being eviscerated by the hardcore fans, I think it's safe to say AC/DC is over now. It's over when Angus says it's over, but it will never be the same.Oh it's safe to say, rip GeorgeWait does Angus actually have cancer or is this a joke because he smokes so much Joke. But you never know. That little guy sucks down those cigs like there's no tomorrow.To be fair, I don't think Axl Rose's voice is a poor fit for post-Scott AC/DC. But the writing has been on the wall since Malcolm's stroke: whatever is left of the band is not long for this world.Angus actually gave up smoking a few years back. Damage has been done but the lungs are extremely resilient, especially after you quit smoking. Sad to see how quickly Mal deteriorated though. AC/DC as we know it is over, especially with Cliff retiring and Phil being arrested for something every few years. Angus still seems like one of those guys that'll find a way to keep playing as long as he can. Will be interesting to see what his future holds.He'll go on tour with The ABBA Experience. Together they'll play one night stands at all the Indian casinos and county fairs in the Pacific Northwest.Sadly, this is but another nail in the AC/DC coffin.  the two parts of their sound are gone.  The Voice (albiet not "dead"), and the consistency.  Seriously, this month sucks.The "voice" froze in a car when I was 12.More like choked to death on his vomit, RiP, sexiest voice everRide on.I wonder if he actually lived to the time when he stopped waiting round to be a milionareWay better than choking on *somebody else's* vomit.You can't dust for vomit.Jesus christ this got dark fast Just how many nails are there going to be? Phil is out, then Malcolm, followed by Brian, and then Cliff. George passing leaves just Angus and I guess Stevie who just joined? Is Slade back on drums?I'm pretty sure Slade is drumming.Fun fact: He was the "Guitar George" in the lyrics of Sultans of Swing by Dire Straits.I initially was sad, then I realized that even with the band members slowly breaking down, they kicked ass and didnt do any pansy crap. always respected each other and really were a family. I will always give them credit for being true to themselves...Seriously, AC/DC is one of the most successful acts in rock history. Not only did they have a bunch of big hits, they did it all with a minimum of controversy (with the obvious exception of Bon Scott's death).Well, their drummer, Phil Rudd, did cause a bit of a stink a few years ago. His solo album flopped so he called his personal assistant and threatened to kill them. Police also found meth and weed in his home, but I suppose those are fairly tame when talking about rock stars. &gt; always respected each other and really were a family.Ehhh, to some extent. I'm a huge fan of AC/DC, but the way they kicked Brian to the curb after 40 years rubbed me the wrong way. I know the show must go on, but it sounds like they didn't even talk to him about it. As soon as he got his diagnosis, they basically had his bags packed for him.I see it more as the difficult choice a friend has to make for the sake of their friend. His condition was ongoing for quite some time. Brian was stubborn as hell and he wanted to keep singing, even when he would quite probably lose all his hearing. The others just put their foot down for his own good. I hope that's how it was, but Angus has always been very business-oriented. I don't know that he's said anything about it, though, so I don't know his side of the story.All love to The Easybeats- the AC/DC Youngs get the spotlight but "Friday on My Mind" is a forever garage punk jam...and Keith Richards just gets stronger...I'm pretty sure whenever a rock legend dies their powers go to Keith Richards. It's basically a Highlander situation with no rhyme or reason. So it's basically a Highlander sequel.Know George, know AC/DC. No George, no AC/DC. Or, vice-versa.Man...AC/DC are done...but..what a run that was! [Highway to hell live at River Plate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEPmA3USJdI)The whole of Live at the River plate is epic. how can a band sound better live than on a mastered CD!?It's a bummer to see the band fade away member by member. AC/DC has been and will always be my favorite band of all time ever since I was in preschool bumping You Shook Me on the way to class with my dad. I am lucky to have seen them perform three times with most of the band intact.They put on a show like none other. Even in their 60's they were rocking harder than guys half their age. I have yet to be at a show with the same electric environment as an AC/DC one. It's seriously like a mass religious experience.Rock In Peace George.for those about to rock... WE SALUTE YOU! Rip.For those unaware of George Young's significance, he produced some albums and played multiple instruments in early recordings for AC/DC, prior to having an established lineup. High Voltage actually featured George Young on bass guitar, prior to the hiring of Mark Evans. George was also one of the masterminds behind the Easybeats, a pop group that was in the vein of the Beatles in the mid to late 60s. The Easybeats were influential in that it gave George Young the tools to continue having a producer's role in music for decades and it provided invaluable advice to the Young brothers when AC/DC were still in their early days. George helped the band get noticed locally and then helped set up their first European tours. His importance to music in that era cannot be understated.Was this guy like the fifth beatle? Edit: I suck at jokes i didn't think it'd actually spark a debate just supposed to be an arrested development referenceEdit2: my bad it was a Bob &amp; David referenceDepends on which fifth Beatle you're talking about. Some folks call George Martin, their producer, the 5th; and some call Billy Preston, the keyboard player the 5th....well George Young was AC/DC's producer.[Or Clarence Walker, the fifth member who was kicked out because he was black.](https://vimeo.com/8904532)Billy Preston was also black. I don't have time to watch your video, about to go to the dentist. I'll have to check into this but it's the first I have ever heard the Beatles being racist.  EDIT - oh shit, we're talking about an Eddie Murphy movie aren't we?It's an SNL skit.Yeah it was originally called She loves you, man! Help me, man haha classic skitGeorge Martin was the fifth Beatle, hands down. Pete Best was gone by the first album. Sutcliffe? Even lesser case. Billy Preston was just a ring-in to stop the band fighting during Let It Be sessions. Yoko? Fuck no. Don't get me started.George Martin was the producer on every album (bar one) and a huge contributor to everything about their music. He was knighted for a reason!Neil Aspinall should be considered above all of these.The Beatles chief legacy is their recorded output, not their live concerts. I know Neil was VERY close as a friend, but George Martin helped craft the music itself. You can replace a road manager, but not a producer of the calibre of Martin.I remember going to see ACDC in Toronto for SARS stock! was a great time 500,000 people! George you will be missedYoung died old? IronyRIP George. I will be blasting ACDC all night tonight in your honor. What the fuck happened to Axl Rose... damn...Now he is truly is Down Among The Dead Men...R.I.P :(Oh shit that title scared me.  They have so many Young's, Angus, Malcom, Stevie...Aaron Ramsey strikes again! Guess he's on the Highway to Hell.Sorry to learn...70 is quite young by today's standards.Its actually just below average age of deathQuite young? As in Tortoise years?
I was 100% certain I would read this line before I clicked on the article, "Undercover FBI agents supplied Solano with a hoax bomb, which he allegedly planned to detonate at the mall" as that's the only what they can catch them.&gt;, and is considered standard procedure in the post-9/11 world.That's my perosnal favoriteSo?  If you are willing to detonate what you think is a real bomb in a crowded area, I have no problems with the FBI doing stuff like this.  What would it take to get you, (who I assume is) a sane and law abiding individual to do this?The guy showed intent and as far as I'm concerned, he deserves a cell right next to the guy who actually pulled off an attack.I totally agree. At first, I hated those bait car shows because it entraps people. But then again, if I were to come across a car with open door and keys in it I would either do nothing or take the keys and call the police, not steal the freakin car.  The issue is sometimes they take it a little too far and bait and encourage and prod people just a little too far in order for them to do so. They been know to radicalize people that normally wouldnt or dont have the mental capacity to do so. It just makes me a little uncomfortable sometimes.It would be like this, you have a guy that doesnt fit in and voices displeasure at our society. They would then encourage them and tell them the world needs to prove they are right. They may say oh I dont want to hurt people but then get a response back to something like but the world doesnt mind hurting you one bit. It just keeps going right this until they actually make steps towards the FBI's plans.Its just a small step from entrapping someone to thinking its ok to frame someone that you are sure in your gut is a threat or just precrime criminalization. I'm not saying its a terrible thing always, its just something that we should pause to think about. Are we manufacturing the threat.I used to know a guy who suffered a TBI. Afterwards, anyone could convince him to do anything. A few bad "friends" convinced him to shoplift, steal, rob houses. He got arrested and his parents had to start taking care of him again. If someone wanted to convince him to set a bomb, it may have been possible.Then maybe they shouldnt be out in public if you can convince them to kill people so easily.Well yeah he went back to live with his parents before it got that far. I don't live there anymore, but I heard he's doing much better. it is kind of concerning you think people shouldn't be allowed in public for crimes they might commit. Yeah but if the FBI can convince them to do it, couldn’t actual radicals convince them just as easily? Entrapment? Are you kidding me I'd consider that giving him a fake bomb isn't entrapment, because he has every opportunity to not use it&gt; The guy showed intent and as far as I'm concerned, he deserves a cell right next to the guy who actually pulled off an attack.That's called thoughtcrime. How can you say a person is a threat when nothing would have happened were it not for the exhaustive efforts of the FBI to recruit them and stage a fake plot? Especially given the FBI's preference for going after developmentally disabled people and the poor. &gt;  I have no problems with the FBI doing stuff like this. What would it take to get you, (who I assume is) a sane and law abiding individual to do this?In order to commit a crime, you need, Means, Motive, and Opportunity.  *At best* you could argue that he had the motive, but he lacked *means* and opportunity, as functionally admitted by the FBI.&gt;there wasn't evidence to suggest he had any actual connection to the terror group, or any others. Indeed, it further goes on to say that &gt; there was no actual explosive device and the public was never in any danger.If the public was never in any danger because the only people willing and able to provide him with a bomb *weren't providing him with a bomb* how is this a problem?  Are we also going to declare war on the Duchy of Grand Fenwick because they want to destroy the US?Who knows? Let's ask Stephen Paddock.What else should they do exactly? Should they just jump in at the last second like Jack Bauer?This method could be a basis for getting rid of all the homeless people on the street corners... give them the drugs they need to be become drug dealers, arrest them and viola! Clean streets. /sArrest them? Can you please come lecture the San Francisco police on this policy? They are just letting people deal drugs in the open. I'd love this policy. Indeed. I'm also waiting for the line "undercover agents found someone expressing legal, if unpleasant views, and encouraged him to commit a crime, providing him with all the encouragement and support he needed to take that final step".After all, no need to find actual terrorists if you can just manufacture them...You could give most people all of the encouragement in the world and they would never agree take a bomb and murder a bunch of people.Most people don't fall for Nigerian scammers. The ones that do are usually a bit mentally retarded. FBI has found a way to scam people too.Yes because your grandma sending someone $5,000 is the same as someone planting a fake bomb, pulling a trigger, and screaming allah akba death to america!!! Yes. Totally the same.That's irrelevant. There exist some people who aren't criminals but could be persuaded to become one if the FBI used the tools at their disposal to make it happen.When the difference between you being a bomber is you having bombs or not (lol) entrapment kind of becomes a weak defense.Say you've got a guy who's talking out his ass and says he wishes he had a suitcase of cocaine to make money, because his wife's in the hospital and he can't afford the bills. He's confident he could sell it.  Problem is he doesn't have any knowledge of how to get a suitcase full of coke, and couldn't afford it if he did, he may not even have the first clue as to go about selling it.So you come along and front him the suitcase.  Then you put him in touch with a "buyer".  Well, when you arrest him, you've foiled his plot to sell cocaine. Did you just take a dangerous criminal off the streets, or did you just waste resources that could have been  used to infiltrate an actual cocaine smuggling ring?So if the only thing that's stopping someone from raping, torturing and murdering a bunch of children is an access to an underground secluded basement you're saying we shouldn't arrest him after giving him said basement and he had kidnapped an undercover agent posing as a child which he intended to rape, torture and kill? If the only thing stopping you from murdering a bunch of people is a lack of resources you're not some innocent person that was tricked. Anyone that wants to kill someone has sufficient resources. There are tens or hundreds of potential murder weapons in most people's households.   But that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about people who would gladly do so if they only had a certain piece that they deem necessary which they admitted to law enforcement and were on the way to go enact the murder after receiving that piece. There is a stark difference between murder and going breaking bad to save your wife.Hell if you want to phrase it your way if all that was missing for someone to kidnap a bunch of people to take their kidneys to save their dying wife was a clean room with the necessary medical equipment should they walk free if after being given the room and medical supplies they then proceeded to kidnap an undercover agent with the intent to remove their kidneys?I didn't claim entrapment. I claimed the FBI can manufacture terrorists where there isn't one.It's not really "irrelevant" when we know that there exist terrorist groups that look for these kinds of people to use for their own purposes.The FBI is not going to randomly target someone. This person had the attention of the FBI for a reasonDid you read the article?  The suspect already had already planned an attack before the FBI got involved.Would it make you feel better if they gave them real bombs?I'd feel better if they went after the people who have their own bombs.&gt; the FBI determined he seemed far from constructing a working explosive so we let him be.Yeah, being proactive is the issue here.&gt;The FBI determined he hasn't committed any crimes so we encouraged him to commit one. Is a bit closer.Why does reddit hate police misconduct, except when targeted at brown people of different religions?I think the FBI tactic is sound as long as they're keeping it all above board. For example, there was a recording they did with one of these guys a few years ago, where the FBI agents were saying, "Children could die, are you sure you can live with that? Are you sure you really want to do this?" And on and on.    It seemed clear from the guy's responses that if the FBI wasn't involved in the fake bomb sting, this guy would have been having a much different conversation with someone else. His answers were pretty shocking.    So no, I don't think it's misconduct when it's done like that, and I'd support the tactic no matter the perpetrator's skin color.I think we have different meanings of 'above board'.https://theintercept.com/2015/03/16/howthefbicreatedaterrorist/Maybe none of them have bombs? Off of my head, the last attacks were the Boston Bombing and [Ahmad Khan Rahimi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_New_York_and_New_Jersey_bombings) in NJ and NY who was recently sentenced. Remember, even the San Bernardino shooters didn't even try to buy their own guns.There seem to be [a few others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_the_United_States#2010.E2.80.93present) that were stopped when bombs were found.Serious question: Isn't this entrapment? Or is it not considered such because he showed clear intent to commit the act without the FBI giving him a fake bomb?The latter. Entrapment would be convincing him to do something outside his normal behavior.[This handy comic should explain it](http://thecriminallawyer.tumblr.com/post/19810672629/12-i-was-entrapped)The difference is "I'd kill a hundred people if only I had a bomb.""i have a bomb""gimme gimme gimme!"VS"hey kid wanna kill people?""no""come on just do it""no""were friends right? I wont be your friend if you don't blow up people""ok" Isn't this a scare tactic, though? "This guy selling you bomb parts? Could be an FBI sting. Those bastards pull this shit all the time, it's in the news!"I know I'm gonna get downvoted all to hell for saying this, but guys, not everything is entrapment. This guy made a bunch of pro-ISIS videos. I know it's hard to believe there are assholes who want to commit horrible acts like these, but they do exist, and not everything is a conspiracy set up by law enforcement or government. Intent is key here.  It's just like the "to catch a predator" stings.  Is the guy any less guilty because he didn't actually fuck a 13 year old?  He showed clear intent to do it so fuck him.Absolutely agree. Reddit hates terrorists, but also hates reasonable action like stop terrorist-supporting people from performing terrorist acts.Events like these get sensationalized more often than not. And I truly don't blame people for trying to keep law enforcement in check.But I see where you're coming from. Information is the best tool to form judgement.Did anyone here screaming "Entrapment!" actually read the article?  The guy made a bunch of pro-ISIS videos and was already planning the attack by the time the FBI got in on it.  Well, since there are a lot of people who don't understand the concept of entrapment, I thought I'd post a [nice little explanation for you](http://lawcomic.net/guide/?p=633)I can't wait to see the /r/badlegaladvice on the ENTRAPPENING from all the comments on this article.As a rule it's never entrapment, except that one time with the beer garden that it actually might have been.Edit: Be the change you want to see in the reddit meta.Every single one of these stories turns out to be set up by the FBI from the start. There's a long history of them finding mentally ill people, pushing them and convincing them to do bad things, then supplying them with the means to do so, then acting like they foiled something.[Article from 2012](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/opinion/sunday/terrorist-plots-helped-along-by-the-fbi.html)[Another from 2011](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/16/fbi-entrapment-fake-terror-plots)They keep happening. These aren't dangerous people. The FBI finds people they can use to justify their budgets and create fear.Normal people don't see a bomb and say "sweet, I can go blow up a mall and kill a bunch of random people." This guy made videos defending ISIS for crying out loud. Saying he's "not dangerous" is just absurd. [removed]Why are you so confident he wouldn't be able to do the deed? A number of the mass-killings we've had in the US have been committed by mentally ill people.I'm going to take a wild guess and bet that very few bomb makers are cognitively deficient to the point of retardation.There is a difference between mental illness and retardation  So ISIS couldn't have found their new friend in the US and given him a real bomb?What if he decided to shoot up the mall? He expressed extremist views, and when presented the opportunity  to become violent, he took it. Not like it takes a genius to shoot a gun. Look at half the Army. Every time I read "FBI foils alleged plot..." I automatically assume they purposefully pushed some poor sap to the brink, egging him on and coercing him, and then arrested him when he hinted he might go along with their idea.They're just innocent people with the clear intent of murdering and blowing up other innocent people... Not dangerous? Nothing wrong with preventing murdering pyscho and brainwashed fanatics from killing people. It's absurd to see people sympathize with psychos fully intending to murder and blow people up.&gt; These aren't dangerous people. The FBI finds people they can use to justify their budgets and create fear.Wow. So someone that is willing to blow people up and kill hundreds is not dangerous because... they are "mentally ill" which is the argument for every single poor SOB public defender that gets assigned to defending these terrorists.Many people who otherwise wouldn't be a danger to anyone can become dangerous through radicalization and profit. Funny enough, for how much people call Wikipedia Liberal, they've actually removed those links from the page of [unsuccessful terrorist attacks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsuccessful_terrorist_plots_in_the_United_States_post-9/11)&gt;Known propaganda sites used as source material for incorrect claimI've been looking for this for years!Also known as [contrapment](https://youtu.be/RO9ZU40RSqw?t=38s)He should have known that they weren't legit ISIS by not giving him a suicide vest (as opposed to a package bomb).They didn't even give him a complimentary goat.I've never met a complimentary goat. They always tell me I look ba-a-a-a-d. Sheepish joke, I know.Meh, that Abdalam from the Paris attack had a vest and didn't detonate it. Many others influenced by ISIS don't commit suicide.How did this thread turn into the FBI is framing everyone?Yeah but what about The Plot To Bomb The Panhandle?Learn to let goGet looooowWatch the excellent HBO documentary "The Newburgh Sting" for an example of how the FBI entraps "terrorists" and wastes resources to make themselves look good.&gt; wastes resourcesum... am I the only one that is okay with the FBI catching these people upstream and then seeing if they are all talk or actually willing to push the button and when they do push the button they are arrested? Am I really the only one okay with that?Have you seen the doc?  You may feel differently after watching. These men were never a terrorist threat. It was a setup so that the FBI could have a very publicized “win”.   Resources should be spent on actual terrorist threats. And I’m not even addressing the other reasons it was wrong, there are many. i dunno man, im not well off by any stretch of the imagination, but if somebody said "i'll give you 250,000 grand to blow some shit up" , thats gonna be a no from me. james cromitie is a really awful human being who hopefully will never see the light of day, but these guys were more, i guess mercenaries rather than terrorists. they all got what they deserved though.The 4 people from the 2009 sting were so poor they couldn't even afford a bus ticket. They were not radicalized and had no plans of doing anything until the FBI informant offered them hundreds of thousands of dollars. Go watch the documentary. It's pretty eye-opening. you'll no longer trust any headline that contains "FBI foils plot". What did they do to get on the FBI's radar?Posted something edgy on reddit. Half joke, half warning, 100% truth. Nothing. The FBI went looking for vulnerable people at a local mosque. Once they found someone, he found 3 of his friends to help. I might be wrong, but the initial person the FBI found had a family member in the hospital and needed the money to help. Or it could have been one of the friend's that said he would help family member. Like I said, the FBI went after vulnerable people.It's interesting because the informant even knew that the guys were only doing it for the money. And coaxed the guy into lying to saying there down for the cause. It was obvious the dude was lying and wanted only to get the money. You can kinda even hear concern in the dude voice about killing people. He was just an idiot.Inventing crime to save us from. "kinda even hear concern in the dude voice about killing people"Yeah, a real stand-up guy. If the difference between being a good person (while poor) and setting off a bomb to potentially kills hundreds is a hefty sum of money, then I'm glad that piece of shit was taken of the street.I'm guessing you've never been poor enough to not even be able to buy a bus ticket. Try living like that your whole life. I'm sure you wouldn't think they same way you do now.I'm from a third world country . No matter how poor I was, my family instilled decent values in me. At no point in my upbringing they did teach me that being poor allows me to be a murdering piece of shit.edit: I assume youre a wealthy white person.. trying to a be one of the "good guys" by being overly empathetic with poor people.I think he agrees that those are terrible ppl, just he think they have a reason. Sometimes it is your dying brother in the hospital that needs money vs you being a terrorist to get the money for him. They are horrible ppl. But money really can turn vulnerable ppl into crazy ppl. The only difference is just whether they get help or manipulated or just died inside helplessly.oh yeah I never thought of that before. Killing innocent people for money is ok now if you're poor enoughWhen did I say it was okay? I only told you their train of thought. Step in someone else's shoes for a second.i understand where you are coming from, but you do have to admit, that line of reasoning is sort of a slap in the face to the majority of people who do live a decent life while being poor. i can't pay my bills, but im sure as shit not going to kill somebody over it. &gt; offered them hundreds of thousands of dollars.Its going to take a lot more money to make me into a terrorist and I am very much broke. So here is my game plan get the FBI to give me money for a terrorist plot the poof become prince of Nigeria.So what was to stop a terrorist cell offering them money to do the same? These are people that would commit terrorism for a small amount of money. Fuck ‘em. Small amount? It was lifetimes of money. They were poor.  They weren't "terrorists" and "linked to Osama" as the FBI lead everyone to believe.How many "terrorists" do you think you could find if we went into poor neighborhoods throughout the US and offered them lifetimes of money? That was the point. It was a manufactured "plot" that they "foiled". I bet you could manufacture lots of stuff if you offered poor people shit loads of money.But do you really want people who would trade innocent lives for money in your society? I certainly don’t!So why aren't we doing the same for domestic terrorists? I'm sure we could catch a lot of alt-right and antifa "terrorists" if the FBI went around offering them money to blow stuff up.Is that not being done? I’ve heard that the KKK is fairly infiltrated. In this case?  I guess it depends on how much you like Florida.Personally I don't like it at all.Savage comment.Well that's a very simple way to look at things. If you actually read more or watch more and learn more you might think differently.[Article from 2012](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/opinion/sunday/terrorist-plots-helped-along-by-the-fbi.html)[Another from 2011](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/16/fbi-entrapment-fake-terror-plots)I'm okay with it in theory but I guess I'll have to watch the documentary (and then do additional research because basing an opinion off a single biased source is bad) to see if I agree with it in practice.No, not at all. People on Reddit don't understand what entrapment means at all. They just think that any sort of sting is "entrapment" and is therefore bad.lol what is there to arrest after they push the button, chunks of meat and body parts?ah.. you're not familiar with what the FBI has done in the past. Anyways, they literally create a button on a handheld device and give it to the wannabe terrorist and tell them, if you push this button, the bomb will blow up and everyone inside of that room will die. The wannabe terrorist then pushes the button. no joke, [this happened in Chicago already.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-arrested-after-planting-fake-bomb-in-chicago/)  They will also create a fake bomb and let the terrorist play around with it and then go plant it in a bar or something. i'd rather not play around with such bullshit, can you fucking imagine the uproar if they played this game but the guy used a real bomb and it went off? holy shit LOL the whole concept is very disturbingI'll add that to my list. Have you seen [(T)error](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt4370922/)? It's pretty interesting. Looks good, I will watch it, thanks. Agreed.  Nothing but a false face to make themselves feel like they’ve accomplished something. It’s like they’re trying to make us tax payers feel better for all the money that goes down the drain with fbi, dea, doh and others.  Very sad.  Oh look, top idiotI've seen it.  It was interesting.In this case, the suspect already had already planned an attack before the FBI got involved.ITT: /r/conspiracy has invaded.I'm waiting for some idiot to bomb a dead mall with no one in it.What do you mean a dead mall?Lotta shopping malls out there that have lost their anchor stores and have lots of vacant store fronts inside because nobody goes to the mall anymore. The middle class doesn't have the disposable income it used to have, and everyone shops online and at Wal-Mart these days.jesus christ here we go again. FBI, fake bomb, lone wolf, haven't we heard this all before in Texas.There's currently a serial killer at large in Tampa that has murdered 3 people so far, they just caught a guy in my town with a goddamn armory of weapons that was planning to shoot up an elementary school, and now this. What the fuck is going on in Florida these last few weeks?What town was this with the could-have-been school shooter? I live in Lakeland.[removed]Lawyer here; LEOs talking someone into committing a crime is not entrapment. LEOs offering to pay someone to commit a crime is not entrapment. That's simply not what entrapment is.Entrapment is when you are forced to commit a crime, or tricked into participating in a crime against your will. The 'against your will' part is the kicker. Based on this article it looks like this guy was happy to blow something up before the FBI encountered him. Selling him a fake bomb and using that as evidence he was planning a terrorist attack is absolutely not entrapment.Agreed. I would think that the average person, when approached by someone espousing a concrete plan for violence would immediately report that person to law enforcement. IMO it does not matter if these persons were not "true believers" of whatever ideology they were exposed to. They crossed the line when they were willing to not only remain silent but then to take part in a conspiracy of  violence. It does not matter if they were half-hearted or had doubts.Put yourselves in their shoes. Imagine someone came to you and said that they believe in &lt;insert ideology/belief&gt; and encouraged you to help them &lt;insert act of violence&gt;. Would your response as a HUMAN BEING be to:* A) report them ASAP* B) do not report them BUT do not help them* C) do not report them AND agree to buy them pencils for their cause* D) do not report them AND agree to take part in the violenceIf you chose C or D then you have crossed the line. If you chose B you are shitty human being but are probably not a criminal unless you are a person required by law to act in a certain way.The only standing question IMO is whether these persons are competent to stand trial. Insanity, etc. is an affirmative defense though. Any person going down that route would have to admit their commission of a crime before arguing diminished capacity, extenuating circumstances, etc.So now all crimes are just entrapment gone wrong?Yes, that's exactly what they said.At what point was any law enforcement involved prior to the Las Vegas massacre?I think this is going to be a bad trend going forward. Aren't we really only showing how easy it is to radicalize unstable Americans?Entrapment or not, people like these guys need to be put away or put to death. This guy was obviously interested in these acts and was browsing around on these exremist forums/ sites on his own free will. Regardless of who contacted who, he had the intent to commit the act and would've done so if he was in contact with an actual extremist.Why is this not considered entrapment? You supplied the bomb. How you can charge someone with something you gave them. It doesn’t make any sense. Entrapment only applies when you are coerced to do something you wouldn't otherwise do.  If he was seeking a bomb and planning to bomb a shopping mall, the FBI supplying a fake bomb is not entrapment.That said, the FBI has a reputation in recent history for entrapping people in "foiled terror plots."  You'll often see them as a blip in the news, "terror plot foiled, 6 arrested" and then never ever hear of them again.  In some cases, it's been revealed that the entire reason this "plot" was discovered was because an FBI informant was the real driving force in the group.  Is this entrapment?  Would they have done anything without the help of the informant?  We'll probably never know because they take plea deals and none of that gets into the public record.A glaring example of entrapment by the Feds is the case of Randy Weaver of Ruby Ridge fame.  He wanted to modify a shotgun that was sawed off to the legal limit, the undercover who modified the shotguns said they were within the law (and Randy took him at his word), but they weren't.  Then the ATF tried to basically blackmail Weaver to be an informant in some Aryan organization that they thought he was a member of.And as we all know, the Feds eventually murdered his son and wife.  A wonderful story.Well, for starters is appears he had the *intent* to begin with, or you know, he wouldn't have been game.  The rest of it just solidifies his intent into planned action and the FBI has the script.I don't particularly like the way the FBI is going about stuff like this but it does not fit most laws written for entrapment in the US.Most of the entrapment laws in the US require the government entity to take an action that would make a reasonable person commit the crime.At least in this case it seems the guy was being radicalized before the FBI involvement unlike some of the others.According to the article he was already planning the attack.Do people really have a problem with the FBI jailing terrorists now?Terrorists yes.  But the FBI has a documented history of basically exploiting poor people who have no intention of causing harm to create terrorism so they can claim they are doing their job.In this case, it seems he had planned to do something anyway, reportedly at least.  This is a bit different and acceptable if the facts line out the way they claim.No problem with jailing terrorists. I’ve just payed attention to what has happened over the last fifteen years. The government in general has leaned more and more on terrorism as a means to justify setting people up and taking away basic liberties. I.e patriot act. I just see a general trend that I am not very fond of. Today it’s Terrorist being setup. Will Tomorrow be you? The FBI found out about someone that was planning to bomb a mall. They supplied him with a fake bomb to carry out the attack and he tried to. This isn't a setup I have any fear of falling prey to.Yeah, I think it makes much more sense for the FBI to avoid letting the dude buy a legit bomb and use *that*. This way people don't have to die.[deleted][deleted]Well probably not...the government doesn't give a shit about him unless they think he's a threat. perhaps he shouldn't have been planning to blow the mall up, and perhaps he shouldnt have accepted the bomb. if you do the wrong thing, entrapment or not, you should be punished i guess you are an ISIS sympathizer or a terrorist. how do you think a normal person would react? they would not accept the bomb Watch, "The Newburgh Sting."An FBI informant found four, bored, unemployed, Muslim black kids, talked them into building bombs in exchange for a shit load of money, arrested them, and put them in jail for 25 years.The FBI literally talked them into building the bomb, and then arrested them.But you can see how this case is different from that one and isn't entrapment, right?I don't think anyone can say anything about comparing these cases until it goes to court. All that this article says is an informant tipped off the FBI that he was planning an attack and they gave him a fake bomb before arresting him. If the informant is a close relative and had detailed knowledge of the guy before then that's one thing, if it's just a racist neighbor who said "he looks like he's up to something" then that's another. We don't know anything but what the FBI is saying, wait until both sides get a chance to tell the story before making up your mind. You're leaving out the pro-ISIS videos he made.Maybe, I don't know. The media went nuts in 2009 when those kids were arrested in Newburgh. Al Qaeda plot, funded by terrorists linked to Bin Laden...all of it was complete bullshit.All I know is, when the FBI says they stopped a guy with a fake bomb, the first thing I do is wonder if they set him up like those kids in New York. &gt; An FBI informant&gt; The FBI literallyWhich is it.I think its good that the FBI offers money for people to commit crimes and then arrests them. It makes it so when people get offered money to commit illegal acts they worry that it might be a setup and choice to not be a criminal. I mean its not like the FBI convinced them that this was something legal right?This tactic has been used a few times to arrest people on terror charges. I don't have a source right now, but I remember an attorney fighting the case in the recent past.Their defense was that the FBI coerced the suspect into actually planning and attempting to carry out the attack. I never heard the outcome of the case but I remember thinking it was interesting at the time.There's a former counterterrorism officer who wrote about this and he said these types of cases form the majority of their work.The danger in this approach is that you run the risk of them committing the act before the FBI has a chance to swoop in and save the day.&gt; Two officials confirmed to CBS News that there was no actual explosive device and the public was never in any danger.    No comment on the entrapment aspect, but with regards to public risk, there was none.I think you're talking about The Newburgh Fourhttp://nypost.com/2014/07/20/newburgh-four-terrorism-case-was-fbi-entrapment-hbo-film/&gt;But Mike German, a former FBI agent not involved in the case, told the filmmakers the sting turned the men into people they were not.&gt;“Were they the best people in society? No,” he said. “But they weren’t terrorists, and this government operation over the course of the year was specifically designed to turn them into terrorists.”The Garland Texas/Draw Muhammad shooting looks like another case where the FBI went to great lengths to facilitate the attackhttp://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/02/10/records-undercover-fbi-agent-near-garland-terror-attack/97740354/&gt;The fact that there was an FBI agent at the contest in Texas who was in contact with Simpson has drawn criticism from Kareem’s lawyer and the security guard’s lawyer. They say the government has not been forthcoming about the agent’s role in the plot and have questions why the agency didn’t break up the plot.**EDIT:** Fixed a broken link and quoted textThis guy was neck deep in radicalization to begin with. Someone who sympathizes with isil is a terrorist. Just as someone who sympathizes with nazis is a nazi. Do you think for one second, it would be acceptable to allow an extremist to hurt innocents just as to steer clear of legal grey area, you aren't awake in the same world. The cost of freedom is eternal vigilance.That is not what anyone is saying. We don't know where the line is between a sympathizer and someone who will eventually commit an attack.So the question becomes, would this person have actually attempted an attack if they weren't provided the opportunity.The same question can be raised if the government does the same thing with a large quantity of drugs, or many other crimes.The question being raised is "if the FBI didn't provide the opportunity, would the crime have ever actually occurred?", which is an important question to ask.No one is sympathizing with a terrorist, we are just questioning if this is the best way to prevent attacks, and if there is a possibility this tactic could be abused.The opportunity is what creates a terrorist. That's not exactly cloudy moral ground. If you were given the opportunity to rape a woman, would you? If you would, given the opportunity, you need to be in jail. It's the exact same for terrorists. If you don't provide the opportunity, it will eventually come along in uncontrolled conditions. Get them before they actually have the real opportunity to harm people. This suspect was fully expecting to harm people and the attempt and intent are the crime.Yeah guys, *anyone* would have tried to bomb a mall given the right supplies! He didn't have to accept it. He could have said he didn't want no part of it and called authorities on the agents.Based on the FBI's history I'm willing to bet here is what happened.Mentally ill man shows himself to be crazy on social media. Undercover FBI agents contact mentally ill man and slowly talk him into a crime. Just before mentally ill man is going to attempt the crime, that's not real, they swoop in to stop the crime. Which once again wasn't real and wouldn't exist without the help of the FBI agents.You see that way they can claim they stopped a terrorist attack and justify their operations.I got a tumor from that title. There is a mall called Florida Mall so I was a little concerned there was another plot for them too.They should have made it a glitter bomb and detonated it while he was trying to arm it. His mugshots would be all sparkly.Apparently the ATF is doing this as well. Finding mentally slow young men, buying the shotgun, telling them to saw off the barrel and then arresting them. Does it seem too far-fetched that the FBI would do it as well?&gt;Does it seem too far-fetched that the FBI would do it as well?Sadly - nohttps://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170819/21022638044/fbi-terrorism-sting-nets-paranoid-schizophrenic-previously-found-incompetent-state-court.shtmlandhttps://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150316/17433230331/fbi-pins-terrorist-nametag-retarded-fool-without-pot-to-piss.shtmlandhttps://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151229/14333133193/fbi-turns-18-year-old-with-iq-51-into-terrorist-dumps-case-into-laps-local-prosecutors.shtmlA friend and I have been talking about this for several years. It's almost like they do these things to justify their existence. When is the last time they broke up a true terrorist ring? Not one they funded, supplied and guided but a true cell.  Its possible that they may have done. But counter-intuitively,  it's the real terrorist cells that you wouldnt get to hear about.Jesus Christ I go to that mall at least once a month shit just got real for me.Is this another case where 3 undercover FBI agents frame a retarded guy?You fools! Blow up all the shopping malls you want, nobody ever goes there anymore!People visit dolphin mall pretty often it's always packed on weekendsThe last time I heard about the FBI arresting *terrorists* about to strike was an obvious case of entrapment of some disaffected blacks who had no ability and no real desire to commit an act of terror. The undercover agent had led the group along and promised to lead the way as they reluctantly listened to his terrorist pep talk.I think it was [The Newburgh Four](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/12/newburgh-four-fbi-entrapment-terror). Things got. Or maybe it was the [Liberty City 7](https://theintercept.com/2016/06/12/before-nightclub-shooting-fbi-pursued-questionable-florida-terror-suspects/). Whichever, whatever, there seem to be a lot of FBI agents with too much time on their hands to seek out real terrorist and who's professional ambition is outpacing the supply of real terrorists to bust for a promotion so they make them themselves.Oklahoma terrorist arrested 3 months ago driving a truck loaded with fertilizer bomb.White terrorist, maybe does not apply here.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/us/oklahoma-van-bomb-domestic-terrorism.html?_r=0Ya, ineffective use of resources in that case.

Something like this almost happened to me!  When I was 11-12, my dumbass hick cousin shot a bow straight up into the air.  We ran different directions and I swear to god that arrow hit the ground literally touching my right tennis-shoe toe.  It actually touched the rubber of my sneaker as it buried itself into the ground before me.  Never went back over there again, not even joking that was the last time we ever played together.  I knew I almost died.  I knew it.I had a "friend" like that. Hit me in the collar bone with a baseball bat and then cried when I got mad. i expected that to go "then got mad when i cried", but this is soo much betterHe obviously transformed into a monster like beast upon being hit.Yeah, he was really scared I was going to hurt him, ironically. Sounds like someone bigger than him probably hit him a lot.Yeah, that kids dad was fucking creepy. I had a "friend" like that as well. He was a boy who lived down the street from me that I played with sometimes. I'm female. I think I was 9 and he was 11. For no particular reason he picked up a baseball bat and hit me as hard as he could with it on my lower leg. He actually smiled as he did it. I still remember the blinding pain and the way my leg swelled and turned purple. My mother worried it was broken and took me to the ER. Luckily, it was just badly bruised. His parents got an earful from my parents and I was never allowed to play with him again. I've wondered if he grew up to be a violent person.Yeah, this kid hit me hard enough to make me really fucking mad. I cussed at him until he ran away and got his dad. I know this sounds unbelievable, but I cussed at his dad too. I was in a lot of pain. My parents were confused why his dad was mad at ME for getting hit with a bat. Vote me president. My slogan is going to be "Make America Sparta Again". My first and only order of business will be to [bring back cliff-throwing of children.](https://ancietgreeceblk3.wikispaces.com/file/view/spartan_babies_paint.jpg/102354593/488x215/spartan_babies_paint.jpg)I had a "friend" too, I was five and I don't remember his age. Long story short he decided to cut down a tree with a shovel and the blade flew off and stuck in my forehead. There was blood everywhere and after some stitches I wasn't allowed to ever play with him again.&gt;  There was blood everywhere and after some stitches I wasn't allowed to ever play with him again.Yikes. No wonder I had a friend who shot arrow at me and actually hit me it the arm. It was a cheap bow and arrow set and he didn’t fire it very hard so it only left a small scratch but it was from pretty far away. I was so pissed so I took it from him and was like “alright fucker, your turn”, fired, totally missed him, hit the house and his mom came out screaming. At the time I didn’t think much of it but now looking back it was pretty crazy.I was not much older than that when a friend of mine actually fired an arrow at me thinking it was fun.  Fortunately for me they didn't notch it right and the feathering caught on the bow and the entire thing flip flopped all over the place.  I was able to dodge and swat it out of the air and then parents intervened.  He was laughing the entire time.  I was not happy. Admit it, swatting that arrow out of the air made you feel pretty badass.When I tell the story I tend to not mention the fact that the guy notched the arrow wrong and didn't draw the bow correctly.  I simply swatted it out of the air to show that he couldn't fuck with me. I wonder if someone that's good at the maths could ELI5 how fast that arrow was going after accounting for wind resistance.  Let's say your cousin was shooting a bow capable of 246fps and using 30 inch arrows that were 8.6 grains per inch with a 100gr field point on it and blazer vanes weighing 8 grains.  How fast would that arrow be going when it hit the ground accounting for wind resistance.  What's the terminal velocity of such an arrow?  It was going jolly fast.Jolly my ass.  I'll bet there was nothing jolly about that!  *I'll* jolly your ass.!You can jolly my ass...you'll get their jolly in your assMMM jolly rancher's.The name checks out You really sure you want that when he has reeking_crotch_rot...This guy maths/r/theydidthemathNot good at maths, but I'm a C+ student in google. https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15l6ix/if_i_were_to_shoot_an_arrow_straight_up_in_the/Thank you random internet stranger!&gt;Note that this velocity would be the same if you had simply fired the arrow directly at the ground. However, if we account for air resistance, the arrow would be going slower when it hits the ground than when it leaves the bow, since the air acts as a force opposite the direction of motion, slowing the arrow down. I can't show you a calculation for that since it is a differential equation which I do not know. Can anyone explain that differential equation?  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Hy9KJ48YQHere is an example where they use differential equations to account for air resistance slowing down an object that is falling. I don't understand the math, only the googling required to find this. The basic idea is that the air resistance is higher with higher speed (proportional with the square of speed), so what percentage is the terminal speed of the initial speed cannot be given as a constant without knowing the initial speed (even if you know the mass and shape of the arrow). Differential equations are one or two semester courses in university, and Reddit doesn't  even have the mathematical notations required, so I doubt you'll learn it here.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocityInitial speed would be 246 feet per second.  Honestly, I suck at physics, I'm a software engineer. I learned a bit about these things in uni but never used in practice.Not sure what the terminal velocity is, but an arrow fired straight up from a lower poundage youth bow, is traveling fast enough to stick into the metal roof of a mobile home. Source: Played arrow roulette with my cousin, and we both got our asses beat like rented mules when his dad got home.I'm sure it will.  Better to be metal tin roof than your skull.  I'd tell you, but I traded my calculator for the bow and arrow.If they shot it straight into the air it would be like dropping an arrow from what ever height the arrow reached from the shot.By my calculations, the arrow should've gone roughly thirteen miles in the air, which would mean it would hit terminal velocity (~3.8x10^8 m/s) which would have the kinetic energy of about 1000 tons of TNT, given the mass of the arrow. Honestly, the kid's lucky he wasn't immediately vaporized. A grazed tennis shoe should be the least of his worries.Go to /r/theydidthemathReminds me of the film Garden State. This would be know as "Redneck Roulette"It's actually safer to do it with a shotgun.When I was a kid living in rural redneckistan I was visiting my “friend” down the road when he shot me in the eye with his BB gun. Fortunately I was wearing my brand new glasses so the BB didn’t hit my eye, unfortunately it shattered the lens and shards of broken glass went into my eye instead. I began wailing in pain, he went into the house and closed the door. I sat there in his front yard crying for help until his mom came out and told me to go home, then I walked the half mile back home alone. I somehow came out of it with my eye and vision intact. And me and the kid down the street were not friends anymore.  Redneck kids are dumb. Your parents should've sued. Who the fuck just tells a kid to leave like that. Alternate-universe Rickon Stark? I read penis-shoe..the fuck are you doing up there brain?It's amazing how many people don't know that what goes up must come down.Played that game before. Thankfully my dad had told me the trick to winning before I was ever around it. You just don't run.&gt; The sheriff's office says it is treating the incident has a homicide.that's because the incident is a homicide by definition.  I always think it's funny when that wording is used. Everything from capital murder to involuntary manslaughter is homicide.That's because the world literally means "person killing" (Latin).its as opposed to suicide, or incident. A falling rock(not caused by another person) is not a homicide, neither is shooting yourself.And suicide is Latin for "self killing". At least there's some 'cides we don't much use any more like patricide and regicide. On the other hand genocide seems to be booming in many places.I wish I could be convicted of regicide, but alas I wouldn't be able to do such a thing to Regis Philbin. Wouldn't a better translation actually be " man slaughter "I am not a latin expert. *Caedes* (the root in \*cide) [does](http://latin-dictionary.net/search/english/slaughter) also mean slaughter, and *homo* seems to work for the generic male (manslaughter is not limited to males), so you are right.More than that: self defense is a homicide.I especially facepalm when people freak out whenever a coroner rules a police shooting as a homicide, as if the coroner is some sort of legal specialist You forgot negligent homicide, which is less serious than involuntary homicide (in the states/jurisdictions that have it).What happened to kids just having water-pistols or spud guns. Back in the 1960's schools had gun clubs.http://www.kilduffs.com/School_679_Baltimore_PattersonHigh_RifleClub_1967.jpgThey also had gun safety classes in elementry schoolhttps://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/150129-gun-safety-02.jpg?quality=85&amp;w=838Students used to take their rifles to school for school sponsored shooting competitions.https://i.pinimg.com/originals/07/c4/fa/07c4faf33f39fc687d38c63e6134c466.jpgNow if a elementary school kid uses a his hand to pretend to shoot another student the school goes in lock down and SWAT teams are sent to search every room.What has changed?My school still has a trap shooting team, if I recall correctly. They did when I graduated (2013)./r/traps would like a word with youHope they're not at work. Wow, they must have had mass shootings every single day.  /sI think a lot of schools still do as extra-curriculars.Can confirm, one time I was suspended for using finger guns in elementary school. I was always a well behaved kid, but for some reason the teachers didn't like me saying "im gonna kill you! Pow pow *finger gun shit*".I got in trouble for impaling my friend with an imaginary sword made of air. ***You monster.***If it was made of air it wasn't imaginary, you almost killed your friend.I got in trouble for pretending to dump my closed water bottle on somebody. No joke. I got in trouble for throwing powerade on a girl after she snuck up behind me and dumped powerade down my back. I still have the write up if any wants to see it.When they say zero tolerance they mean it.Was it an *imaginary* friend?Wow, did he ever recover?I got sent to the principal in fourth grade because my nerd friends and I liked to run around the corners of the recess yard pretending we were secret agents and Russian spies. After talking to us for about 30 seconds he rolled his eyes and told us not to play that game when one particular teacher was on recess duty. Good guy Mr. Fedder.In 6th grade about 18 years ago I got suspended for folding a paper triangle and pointing it at a lunch lady like a gun. I get the zero tolerance stuff but come on a yellow triangle looks nothing like a gun. I had to write my name on the board in kindergarten for calling a crayon naked, because it didn't have any paper on it.Pewpeepewpew laser finger shitMN State HS League sponsors clay target shooting...https://www.mshsl.org/mshsl/claytarget.aspI'm sure you can't bring your gun to school, but it's not as if they're treating guns like the plague either.Like you guessed, its not on school property. These clubs exist all over, where kids from school can get a carpool to the gun range after school and go shooting as a 'school club.' Just to be clear no sane school would ever take responsibility for letting kids store or use firearms on a school grounds in today's media environment. Back when though, you could go shoot skeet behind the football field, I think thats the difference some are trying to point out. Honestly, its probably a good thing. Shooting club was off campus at the local range for us with parent/teacher supervision obviously. Its disingenuous to imply it had the same implicit right to exist as a sport or an extracurricular like Chess club, the shooting club was always in danger of being disbanded if people were not responsible, again probably for good reason. Man if chess is a sport then skeet shooting is definitely a sport.Some schools in PA still have rifle teams. My school had an indoor range right next to the library. This was in upper middle class suburbia. It was very surreal to shoot guns inside a school. Gun safety classes should be a thing again. I think it would really quell much of the stigma surrounding peoples' irrational fear of firearms. I don't see why... the fear of firearms isn't really a fear of people properly handling them. Its a fear of all the idiots out there who obviously don't. Just like proper drivers ed doesn't mean you aren't afraid of the asshole who swerves in and out of traffic and runs "pink" lights. Well, improper handling would decrease if more people were educated on firearm safety. The people who sit through the firearm safety aren't the ones i'm worried about though. With cars there is a mandated safety test to prove that you at least kind of know what you're doing. With guns they can't put any sort of restrictions on there without people saying that they are repealing the 2nd amendment and anti-gun. ... that's why people want them in public schools, so everyone gets the training. It's the easiest way to affect the largest number of people without problems of registries and shit.&gt;With guns they can't put any sort of restrictions on there without people saying that they are repealing the 2nd amendment and anti-gun.Maybe that's because the people who talk the most about needing training are also the same fucking people who can't shut the fuck up about banning guns.I don't understand your point. My original comment was about bringing firearms safety classes back to schools. Mandatory fire arm classes? Because I would personally be against that. There is a much larger chance that they are harmed from driving, and most schools don't cover drivers ed anymore either. Kids don't even have time enough in school to learn academics - recreational safety can be taught outside of school. It makes a lot more sense to say "if you are going to use a fire arm you need to pass a safety course" than it does to say "everyone must take safety courses just in case you will use a fire arm". We don't make people who aren't going to drive a car take drivers ed or pass a drivers safety test. So you really, really want firearm training, but you're losing your fucking mind about the least-intrusive and widest-reaching method of instituting it?**EDIT:** Based on your past history talking about guns, how about you just quit lying to us and admit you want mandatory gun training for gun owners specifically so you can institute a registry and fuck gun owners later.Just a simple course about basic firearm safety. The basic fours, having respect for them, telling an adult if you come across one, etc. I'm not talking some semester long proficiency class. If this was something that educators seriously wanted to implement into todays school curriculum, they definitely could. Just like they did with SAT training, DARE, McGruff, Smokey the Bear. DARE is a bad example only because it had the opposite effect lol, but my contention here is if the govt wants to bring about a program, they'll find a way to shove it down the throats of our youth posthaste. Lawsuits.  Now teachers and schools have to crack down on anything remotely gun related, in case that kid actually does bring a gun to school in the future.   Grew up in a farm family in a farm region during the '70's and '80's, not only were there gun racks with guns in trucks (and a few cars) in the student parking at high school, quite a few of use carried pocket knives, with a couple friends had belt knives (they were the ones that also had a flashlight, and minor tool kits on the belt). Hard to believe that now that a kid can get tossed for bringing a butter knife in with his lunch.&gt; What has changed?The prevalence of school shootings over the last 3 decades.But they're asking why. Why have school shootings increased while student access to guns has decreased significantly? Why wasn't it a problem in the days where we took our guns to school and kept them in our trucks or lockers? &gt; Why have school shootings increased while student access to guns has decreased significantlyIs there any indication that student access to guns has decreased significantly? Just because a school doesn't have gun events or allow guns on the property, this doesn't mean that students have less access. &gt;Is there any indication that student access to guns has decreased significantly? The fact that you can no longer keep personal firearms in your vehicle or locker is what I'm talking about. There are exponentially less guns in schools now than there were even 20 years ago. There are certainly far more restrictions, particularly on minors. If those restrictions don't serve to decrease access then what's the point of restrictions at all?Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy.What has changed is increasing population, increasing population density, and the decline of the middle class.People are amped up all the time. Wired. Full of anger. Life sucks. People lash out because they don't know what else to do.America is sick.Schools in the rural Midwest frequently still allow rifles to be on school property if left in your vehicle because so many kids drive trucks with gun racks inside. We learned Archery in middle school in like 2002. Those arrows would definitely be able to impale a kid too, they weren't like plastic suction dart shits.I don't think 13-year-olds have ever been satisfied with water-pistols or spud guns... those are for the under-10s.I was 13 in 1982, and crossbows were pretty popular, as a less-dangerous alternative to actual guns.So this is hardly some new thing.Yeah in rural areas any kid has shot at least a .22 by the age of 10. A crossbow at 13 isn't that unreasonable, especially since they sell real crossbows meant for children.They kept shooting at the black kids with water guns.So they were given crossbows to be more effective. /sThat was never the case.  We used to have lawn darts and pellet guns.Probably don't want to be sued incase anything goes wrong.Um.. back i my childhood archery was still taught in schools. 1980, 7th grade, archery in gym class... It would g the way of disco by 82, not because of any incident, but because adults suck.My rural school still has archery clubs at least. Archery competitions in the school gymnasium after hours anyway.I had archery in gym class between 99-03. Speak for your own adults. Regionalism may apply. This was cleveland public schools. Was your school urban or rural? Was it wealthy?Small school on a military base under DODEA. Just giving ya trouble. I'm from Oklahoma and having been seen some kids behave poorly I know there is very little chance the kid that did the shooting did this accidentally. His intent may not have been to kill his victim but he's old enough to know better. There was a kid that kind of hung around with the rest of us but was always doing stupid shit like shooting everyone with his bb gun or a sling shot, breaking windows, or trying to get dogs to fight. One day he showed up with his dad's .22 and I noped the hell out of there, and made my brother come with. When I got home I told my mother that he had a .22 and that he's a fuckwit. My mom called the cops and they showed up just in time to stop the kid from continuing to shoot someone's house, who was home. After that I wouldn't have anything to do with this kid and managed to convince others that he was nuts. I looked him up recently and he's done time for destroying public property and possession of meth amphetamine. If you grow up in brokelahoma it’s pretty much a given that you’ll know a kid like this. I can think of the dude right now (his name is Logan, and we're in OK), he was a psycho, chased someone with a knife yelling that he was going to kill him (boy scouts). Got the cops called on his family for explosions, saw him in a mall and chatted with him he was missing all his eye brows. "I didn't know it was loaded!"Part of me thinks they don't know what they were doing, but I know my 13-year-old stepdaughter has a pretty good grasp of consequences and there's really no excuse for this kind of thing...Super sad :(Barring some significant mental deficiency, 13 is absolutely old enough to know what a crossbow does. I think there may still be some disconnect though. For many people, guns and other tools aren't "real" in that they only appear in books or television. You might "know" that a sword can cut someone, but lots of young people still try to sword fight for fun when they get their military sabers (usually people don't get hurt with these since they're blunt and fragile though) or cut up their hands while twirling them for YouTube. You might "know" that javelins kill people, but folks threw lawn darts at each other for shiggles. People might "know" that bows were tools of war and hunting, but lots of idiots try to shoot in the air like it's a toy (I personally witnessed this a few times as a kid). You might "know" that a gun can kill, but people shoot each other all the time and get surprised when it actually happens.Our ancient/medieval ancestors or even modern historical martial artists and athletes don't treat swords or javelins as toys because the tools are very real for them. A child raised hunting or shooting for sport tends to be way more safe around firearms because the tool becomes very real for them. It only takes one accident to change most people's behavior, but it also only takes one accident to kill or maim somebody.It's a weird phenomena for sure. I think as you said, it's because people are largely disconnected from those tools nowadays, except as toys. Death and serious injury aren't as common or as up close and personal either, so the idea of someone actually getting hurt seems less real to people.So on the one hand I can understand why, but for myself I've almost always treated those things seriously. I just can't imagine myself being 13 and not thinking I'd kill someone if I shot them with a gun or crossbow.Story time, also from Oklahoma: Once when I was roughly 9 or 10 my home schooled friends, who were brothers, were staying with me. We were all country kids so we all had bows and frequently shot them. We were always pretty careful, but more so when I was around as I was a very cautious child. Anyway so the next day while I was at school my friends were shooting their bows in the hay barn, when the younger brother apparently ran in front of the older's arrow. It went straight through his cheek. Literally avoided death by an inch or two. You can still see the scar from it to this day.Holy crap, that's gotta mess any of the kids involved up real bad. I don't know if it was intentional or if they were just messing around, but either way you don't come out of that experience unscathed.The dead child certainly didn't come out of it unscathed.These comments are making it very obvious a lot of people don't read farther than the headline.This happened on the Sopranos&gt;980267 S. Pecan Meadows.Oklahoma has long addresses.This kid must have watched Game of Thrones. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hHJVvmO8ZbAThis here?This reminds me of an excellent movie called "we need to talk about Kevin" One time my cousin played Russian roulette with a pistol and that was the last time he ever played russian roulette Where are the parents?I realize there may be an explanation that would explain why a parent didn't intervene before things happened, but the question should be raised all the same.For sure, what is a kid who is clearly irresponsible allowed to have a deadly weapon without supervision?This is the only relevant question here.  Seriously, WTF were they??![Longer source](http://kfor.com/2017/10/23/officials-release-more-info-on-tragic-crossbow-incident-that-left-10-year-old-oklahoma-boy-dead-8-year-old-injured/) He also hit an 8 year old in the armSame arrow. It went through the victim and hit the other kid. I had no idea crossbows were so powerful.Really.Why did you think they were used in war for so long then?I mean, I knew they were deadly, I figured the arrows pretty much stuck in whatever they were shot at.Parents should be held accountable for giving the child a weapon that was used to kill someone else....  Who allows a child to have unsupervised access to any weapon?&gt; Who allows a child to have unsupervised access to any weapon?People who have children that aren't complete fuckwits? I was shooting a .22 at 13 unsupervised but had enough wit not to fucking kill anyone. Them your parents were irresponsible, grossly negligent, and you should realize it before you make the same mistake. Can confirm. I had my own .22 and a 20 gauge at 13. &gt; I was shooting a .22 at 13 unsupervised but had enough wit not to fucking kill anyone.To be honest, even you should not have been allowed to use a gun unsupervised at 13.The fact you are responsible doesn’t negate the idea that parents should be criminally liable for giving their children weapons. You were responsible, so your parents weren’t negligent in entrusting you with a lethal instrument. But there are a lot of teenage fuckwits out there whose parents give them guns that the kids shouldn’t be using while unsupervised. Those parents should suffer legal consequences for that choice. &gt;Who allows a child to have unsupervised access to any weapon?Idiots who think their children needs to learn about deadly weapons before they learn about sex.A child can stumble across a weapon unsecured at any number of places, storage laws or no. Kids used to be taught by Eddie Eagle (courtesy of the NRA) to *"Stop! Don't Touch! Tell an adult!*. It's perfectly reasonable for kids to learn about weapons before they hit puberty, because they can encounter them before then. It’s a far different scenario from Eddie the Eagle teaching kids not to touch a weapon vs. parents teaching a child how to wield and fire one. It’s the same caliber of difference between teaching kids “stop, drop and roll” if they catch fire and teaching kids how to use an accelerant and a propane torch to start a trash fire. He has a valid point. Or maybe people that want to share the experience of hunting with their child, like their dad did with them? That's why I taught my kids those topics at the same time.This is horrible. For a 13-year old, an accident is chucking a baseball through a window, when you were going for your friend's glove. Not hitting someone with a crossbow. This is horrifying and I bet the parents deserve some blame here too.It depends on the toys. Baseballs, crossbows or guns.teenagers getting medieval is somewhat better than emo, I guessBut fuck Joffrey thoughSome of those crossbow heads are pretty intense nowadays. I sure as hell wouldn't want to get shot by one of [these](http://flyingarrowarcheryusa.com/broadheads/toxic-broadheads/) for example.Check out these adapters that shoot a .357 magnum round on impact. https://www.sportsmansguide.com/product/index/bow-mag-38-357-magnum-arrowhead-6-pk?a=1692605Awesome. As a Canadian my mind is blown. The RCMP would flip its lid if it saw these.The parents of this boy should be charged with neglect and endangering the welfare of a child for giving him a crossbow as a gift. What fuckwits. Some people really shouldn't be allowed to breed.It troubles me that it doesn't say "accidentally" killed.That's because pointing a loaded crossbow at a person is not an accident and 13 year olds are not 5 year olds, they understand what they are doing.Because it wasn't an accident. The 13 year old tried to kill an 8 year old too[Apoarently I was wrong and the bolt hit two people](http://kfor.com/2017/10/23/officials-release-more-info-on-tragic-crossbow-incident-that-left-10-year-old-oklahoma-boy-dead-8-year-old-injured/)You’re certain it wasn’t a singular bolt that was able to through and through?http://kfor.com/2017/10/23/officials-release-more-info-on-tragic-crossbow-incident-that-left-10-year-old-oklahoma-boy-dead-8-year-old-injured/Yeah. It was just a single shot. I was wrong. Will Edit the commentYou clearly didn't read the article, the investigators believe the teen acted with intent. Maybe next time actually read before you post a comment.sounds to me like a psycho teen trying to kill his innocent, younger friends. but I guess I better wait until the full story comes out. but what is the point of reddit/the internet if i can't wildly speculate on stuff?!If it weren't for the NCA, crossbows would be illegal and this wouldn't have happened.We need to get that Big Crossbow money out of Washington.Aww love to see the homestate on redditGordon Freeman knock offMakes sense.  Been a little over 10 years for me. I do remember the flat tips flying a whole lot better. Target practice I felt like goddamn Legolas but half the time looked like an idiot from the tree stand. This is not a typical 13 year old, clearly. I'm curious if he's a crazy kid or one who has the brain development of a 5yr old in a broken home. Kid received that crossbow as a gift? Wow great parenting there!When i was that age I made my own crossbow ( we made our own fun in those days)To be fair, when i shot through 5 layers of cardboard and the dowl (bolt) ended up in the neibours garden . . .  even i was sensable enough to call it a dayI remember growing up in the late 90s and all the neighborhood kids would gather at the rich kids backyard and beat the shit out onanother with toy plastic lightsabers The shit went through a kid and hit another kid?I grew up on a large ranch. Lots of acreage, horses, and guns. We had an older wood/glass gun safe with a lock I was able to pick. My friends loved coming over to my house as we would be able to reenact WW2 battles with REAL weapons. We would take rifles and shotguns and fire at one another making sure to aim slightly to the left or right of course. Amazing that no one was ever killed or injured. I feel horrible for all these kids. This could have easily happened to a lot of us. [removed]Way to bolt headfirst into controversy.A child is dead....Not mineITT: everyone is quick to be judge and juror.It's seriously amazing how many people here are ready to write this kid off as being a homicidal psychopath even though the only information you have on him is what's in this article. This kind of laziness and lack of critical thinking is exactly why we ended up having to chose between Trump and Hillary. Cue the comments trying to excuse the killer.The bolt went through the 10 year old killing him and into his brothers arm who was standing behind him. This sounds 100% deliberate murder
Kid threw an egg off an overpass and it hit my car once. I suppose I should be thankful in retrospect.He was offering you a nice egg in this trying time.get some mayonnaise and you have mayoneggIt's really cuteEgg Salad*maybe he was just really bad at cookinghow do you mess up eggs?Temp too high, not enough oil, too much oil, not cracking the shells correctly, unintentionally breaking the yolk, etcThis guy cooksWhat?  Just scramble with butter.Seriously, that’s like eggs 101. If you try to make a flambe with Bacardi 151, not only are the eggs rubbery but they taste awful too.I'm a pretty good cook but I can't make an omlette. I usually end up with cheesy scrambled eggs.There was a story from a place I used to live where this kid threw a fire axe off an overpass...can't remember how it ended, I think it killed the guy.I have enough recollection of being a teenager to imagine doing something knowing it was stupid, maybe even knowing it could really hurt or kill somebody, and still being surprised and shocked and horrified and really, really sorry when it actually happens.  There's something about teenager brain that is not totally plugged in to reality yet.  I was a nerdy kid and never dumb or rebellious  enough to do anything *remotely close* to this bad, but I can still  remember a couple of incidents when things backfired on me in ways that should have been really bleedingly obvious but somehow weren't.&gt;It doesn’t matter how smart teens are or how well they scored on the SAT or ACT. Good judgment isn’t something they can excel in, at least not yet.&gt;The rational part of a teen’s brain isn’t fully developed and won’t be until age 25 or so.&gt;In fact, recent research has found that adult and teen brains work differently. Adults think with the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s rational part. This is the part of the brain that responds to situations with good judgment and an awareness of long-term consequences. Teens process information with the amygdala. This is the emotional part.&gt;In teen’s brains, the connections between the emotional part of the brain and the decision-making center are still developing—and not necessarily at the same rate. That’s why when teens experience overwhelming emotional input, they can’t explain later what they were thinking. They weren’t thinking as much as they were feeling.https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&amp;ContentID=3051&gt; The rational part of a teen’s brain isn’t fully developed and won’t be until age 25 or so.Say it with me now: **Demographics**. [Around 57% of reddit](http://response.agency/blog/2014/02/reddit-demographics-and-user-surveys/) is in this group. Explains quite a bit when you step back and consider that.Now cue this comment going controversial from being downvoted by that very group.Probably much higher than 57%. Reddit's own numbers are 6 years old and the site has increased in popularity quite a bit since then. Plus it is based on data for people already inclined to fill out a voluntary survey. 20k users may be a good sample size but really most likely reflects demographics of the most active contributors which if i recall may only be about 1% of the user base. Other polls only included 18 year olds and up. I would not be surprised at all if there is a much larger high school aged demographic than the data shows which could bump the under 25 group to a much higher percentage.  Usually when social media sites grow more popular, the average age goes up, as young people were the first to adopt the platform, e.g. Facebook I've received a great deal of legal education from that group, which routinely announces previously unknown legal principles of great importance.I mean... ok? What’s your point?More than half of the opinions expressed on reddit originate from minds that aren't fully done developing, which are driven by emotions, not logic. This is why. That's my point. Didn't see terribly hard to grasp but there, I've spelled it out.I get that you’re saying that more that half the comments are left by young people with developing brains. But, I feel like most people already understand that. What are you saying we should do with that information? Just ignore 57% of comments because young people supposedly can’t be rational?&gt; What are you saying we should do with that information?Stop treating people on the internet as if they're all rationally minded adults and quoting them as if they're "normal pictures of society", because they aren't. Don't take the internet seriously, because the majority of the users don't. I'm speaking more to the media, but also to those who believe everything the media tells them. It's manufactured outrage for agenda pushing, all the way down, on both sides. Even the offline college protests are far and away a majority well under 25.All those "reddit users say...", "reddit is the new home for...", "twitter users say...", "college students say..." etc? Just keep an image of a pimple-faced teenager on a computer in mind, because statistically, that's closer to accurate than otherwise. Ok, that makes sense. I thought you were talking about how redditors (redditers?) should change how they ise reddit. I agree the media garbage that references reddit instead of doing their own work is something everyone should just ignore. I edited that too: this same logic applies to mostly all the internet *and certainly* most college campuses, as most college students are indeed under 25. So all those college protests that are painted as "the views of a nation", on either side that's being said for? They're not. They're the views of mentally not-yet-developed, overly-emotional young adults without real responsibilities and without real life experience of how society actually works. But surely *they know best*, right? *Right*.&gt;Just ignore 57% of comments because young people supposedly can’t be rational?No, take 100% of them with a grain of salt. Which should really be obvious already, so you've got a point. This doesn't add much to what you should be doing.But why male models?I'm pretty sure the rational part of a brain isn't fully developed for some people ever.I'd be interested to see the actual research.  Depending on how they designed their controls, it might be just as easy to blame this on modern schooling environments as biology.&gt; The rational part of a teen’s brain isn’t fully developed and won’t be until age 25 or so.Quite the apologist. If you’re 16 and don’t know that your actions can kill, you’re in the tiny tiny minority. The vast majority of teens know not to do dumb and deadly shit. It doesn’t take being 25 to know this. You’re missing the point. Logically, kids likely know that what they do can be harmful. However, it is never even considered; that part of the brain that deals with consequences is under developed. This is why peer pressure is so potent at the teen level - the emotional sense of belonging overrides the rational sense of not being a dumbass.Tell me, why does car insurance get cheaper once you hit 26 (in the US)?Happy to disagree with you. And glad the law doesn’t give two shits about this study. I also appreciate how you condescend with “You’re missing the point.” The point ain’t exactly difficult to understand. I don’t have to read Hawking’s PhD thesis to get it. You are free to disagree with the robust research available on the topic.Your point doesn’t even matter, certainly not to the aggrieved or the offenders, thank goodness. The law is very clear about responsibility. There isn’t an allowance for being “under 25”. 99% of teenagers do not commit deadly acts, ever. We’re talking about a minuscule % and you’re claiming this irrationality plagues the lot of them *biologically*. If teenagers are afflicted with irrational AND deadly impulses, where’s the homicide data to back it up?So we always try minors as adults? The juvie system is just designed smaller for smaller bodies, but is otherwise identical to adult jail?The law makes a distinction, though it chooses 18 as the arbitrary line of serious responsibility.I’m not saying all teenagers have deadly impulses. I’m saying teens make stupid decisions because their brains work differently than post-25 adults. This stupid decision happened to be fatal this time. Ask any parent if their child, after being asked what they were thinking while doing something stupid, said “I wasn’t thinking,” or , “I don’t know.” I am not excusing these kids accidentally killing someone, nor do I think they should be let of the hook. Some leniency, however, should be considered in punishment (when compared to a similar situation with an adult).As for the aggrieved, the method of loss is frustrating and saddening, but this man could have died a number of other ways on the highway.  I can appreciate your points here.The law actually does take into account a person's age and their mental capacity when a crime is committed. One example is that a person under 18 can't receive a death sentence or a life without parole sentence. not 25In high school one of my friends randomly threw a rock through someones 2nd floor window. We didn't know what was happening we just heard glass shatter and we all booked it. The following year, he did it again, same house same window. We yelled at him not to do it but he went and did it anyway. Can't imagine what could've happened if there was someone by that window, especially if it was a toddler or an elderly person.I know I did things like typing in addresses on my phone while driving and knowing that it’s very dangerous, but choosing to ignore that fact. This is different. Yeah, I’m sure they’re sorry, but how about think of that before you actively throw rocks at people. That’s not like texting and driving (which IS really bad, but at least you don’t intend to hurt anyone). These teenagers KNEW the rocks would either injure someone or at least cause car damage, and I don’t feel sorry for them. If you can't show the kids can we see their parents?I need someone to focus my righteous wrath on....We should find out about the kids soon enough.It happened in the US. All names will be public soon enough. 4 of the kids are under 17 and probably won't get named because they are considered minor. The one 17 year old may get named.Is this a common sense thing we have to teach kids now? Look both ways when crossing, eat your vegetables, don't throw shit at cars?We've always had to teach kids those things. Kids are dumb and malicious as default settings, you have to tweak them before you let them loose on the world.I don't know about now but kids have been throwing rock and other shit at cars for a long time.I'm 36 years old now and I feel so bad about it, but we used to throw oranges at cars in our teens. Grew up in Orange County, CA.We nailed a cop car one night and must have set a land speed record for running. Fucking so dumb... Teenagers are wild animals.  *edit. We were also so dumb that after each person chased us, we'd go right back to the orange trees after they pissed off. This got us snuck up on a couple times. But again, as teens, we could run like gazelles. It's the Orange County orange thrower! We've been looking for you for a long time. Now we've got a confession. Book em, Danno Sorry buddy. The case wasn't filed in time. Due to my being anonymous until now, the statute of limitations has now passed and I got away with it!Gat dangit, we'll be keeping an eye on you, because sooner or later you'll go back to your orange throwing ways, they always do, and when you do, I'll be there Live by the orange, die by the orange. Bake 'im away, toysFuck common sense. How about an iota of compassion?Do you not remember the girl who doused her friend in boiling water for the 'hot water challenge'?“now”? every bad thing that happens is characterized as new. people, especially kids, have always done fucked up shit. Peer pressure is a helluva drug.  Literally changes your brain.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDu-2UosnEQThey actually taught us against doing this exact thing in school. It was during a DARE class in 3rd grade. They told a story of two friends who threw a big rock off an overpass and killed a woman who had a husband and children. As I remember, they both got life sentences at the age of about 16. I notice from the behavior of the other drivers who were hit before the fatal stone was thrown that we're teaching everyone to look for someone in authority to deal with trouble rather than do anything about it ourselves.  How many stories have there been of kids getting suspended or expelled for dealing with the bully themselves?Five of them and not one thought maybe it was a bad idea?Like I can see one, maybe two but a five idiot clique? Incredible. My thoughts exactly. They charged all five kids but that doesn't necessarily mean they were all involved. Though, they all very well could have been. It's just hard to believe not ONE of them would have spoken up about what a horrible idea it was. It's not like it was just this one car either, they hit a number of them. Unbelievable. It's actually the other way around. The larger the group, the more difficcult it is for a single person to stop a groups dynamic. With three kids, it won't be that hard for one to speak up. But with five, it is way more difficult for one to stand against (seemingly) 4 others. I believe they call that a Confederacy of Dunces.So many lives ruined. It reminds me of a scene from the movie "The Good Son"Bet they each get more than that banker with the 3.5 billion dollars in fraud. [deleted]Second-degree murder charges; they were *intentionally* doing something which they knew to be malicious, which could (and did) result in someone dying.Second-degree murder absolutely fits. There were also four other cars damaged by other rocks thrown. Agreed.  Now if one was trying to throw a big rock at anothers ass, missed, it bounced and it went over the bridge and killed somebody?  That's manslaughter.  Intentionally doing something that you should know could kill others raises it to the level of murder.&gt; Now if one was trying to throw a big rock at anothers ass, missed, it bounced and it went over the bridge and killed somebody? That's manslaughter. Contextually, yes, they would've gotten a lesser charge easily. However *technically* that's still malice: They're still trying to assault someone with a rock in your scenario. That's assault w/a deadly weapon. But I get what you're saying: Had they been trying to throw a rock to each other to play catch, for instance, that'd be a perfect example.&gt; Intentionally doing something that you should know could kill others raises it to the level of murder.Not quite bingo. "You should know could kill" is not the requirement, the issue is the person was *intentionally* trying to perform a malicious and harmful act. The degree of harm possible is irrelevant. It matters in Michigan, where the crime occurred.Manslaughter vs Murder has no solid universality in criminal law across the country.  The various degrees of murder and whether or not they even use manslaughter can vary depending on which state you live in.  In Michigan, second degree murder is intentional but unplanned killing, or accidental death as a result of reckless disregard for human life.  Thus, the "you should know could kill" argument holds up there.  But again, that's Michigan.  In Texas there's no involuntary or voluntary manslaughter, and no degrees of murder.  You either meant to kill someone (murder) or your reckless behavior killed someone unintentionally (manslaughter).I think this will largely depend on the mindset of the teens in question.  Are we talking 13-year olds? I think in their minds, it would just cause damage to the cars and piss a bunch of people off.  If these are 19-year olds - they should have known the dangers of this.I mean - the only difference in my mind is whether this is second-degree murder or manslaughter.  I did a lot of stupid shit when I was a kid, but I think I'd know not to throw huge rocks at cars off an overpass.&gt; Are we talking 13-year olds? I think in their minds, it would just cause damage to the cars and piss a bunch of people off.Right there, you just admitted they were being *knowingly malicious.* And it was a crime. And someone died. *That's second-degree murder*. Manslaughter has two general classes, voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary manslaughter applies to cases with provocation, or "heat of passion" crimes. This wasn't that. *Involuntary* Manslaughter relies on a key phrase: *without malice aforethought*. Meaning "I had no malicious intention to hurt anyone or thing, however someone died as a result of my actions". OSHA violations which end with someone dead, for instance. These kids *knowingly were engaged in malicious acts*. And someone died as a direct result. That's not Involuntary Manslaughter either, it's murder.  They for sure aren't late teens.  If even one of them turned 18 the day before the incident his name and face would be on this article."Notably created a high risk of death. Knowing death or such harm would be the likely result of such actions." - ProsecutorMalice aforethought doesn't necessarily require premeditation.  &gt;  All five teens were charged with **second-degree murder**, conspiracy to commit second-degree murder and six felony counts of malicious destruction of property. In Michigan, [second-degree murder](http://statelaws.findlaw.com/michigan-law/michigan-second-degree-murder-law.html) is either* an unplanned, intentional killing; or* a death caused by reckless disregard for human life.Throwing large rocks onto a freeway arguably counts as reckless disregard for human life.&gt; Murder requires premeditationFirst-degree murder does. This is not the charge.That's like saying "well I drove my car into a crowd, but I didn't think it would KILL anybody!"&gt; Murder requires premeditation with the intent to kill.Well what was their intent then, to only critically injure someone but no actually kill them? That is like shooting and killing someone, but claiming you were aiming for non-vital organs. Did they plan to throw rocks at cars?  Yeah?  Okay so that's the premeditation part.  Unless of course they just happened to accidentally drop the rocks park but it seems unlikely given the umber of rocks thrown.Can throwing rocks off of an overpass at moving cars kill people?  Yes?  Well I guess we have the intent to kill part down too.Murder does not require premeditation. You’re speaking of 1st degree murder. You are right on the Charges though. They should be manslaughter 1. False, manslaughter is an accident. Murder is correct. Yeah I’m sure they totally purposefully killed this man. Savages. They did an action which could clearly lead to death.So does drinking and driving yet that’s manslaughter every time. I live in Michigan and that is often murder two unless it is a plea.They were intentionally doing something malicious and illegal that ended in a death.If they weren't intentionally trying to hurt people and property and then killed someone, it would be manslaughter. "... under many state laws, killing through action showing a depraved indifference to human life can qualify as murder in the first degree."[Source](http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/first-degree-murder-overview.html) Edit: Suddenly everyone in this comment thread has been to law school.This isn't murder in the first degree.From the article:&gt;Authorities announced murder charges at a news conference Monday afternoon in connection with the recent death of a 32-year-old man killed when a rock was thrown off an overpass on I-75 in Vienna Township. &gt;Authorities announced murder charges at a news conference Monday afternoon in connection with the recent death of a 32-year-old man killed when a rock was thrown off an overpass on I-75 in Vienna Township. How do these actions not show a submissible case for first degree murder in a jurisdiction that holds first degree murder to include "... action showing a depraved indifference to human life"? &gt; How do these actions not show a submissible case for first degree murder in a jurisdiction that holds first degree murder to includeMy guess is they mean stuff like arson, kidnapping, and robbery.&gt;My guess is they mean stuff like arson, kidnapping, and robbery.I would think it would include throwing a rock from an overpass. I don't see a court separating that out as an exception - but I could be wrong. All the same, consider the following:&gt;A 23-year-old Spartanburg woman who was a passenger in a car traveling in North Carolina was killed by a rock thrown from an overpass on Sunday night.&gt;The sheriff's office said that Cody Chavis, 16, of Rockingham and a 15-year-old are charged with first-degree murder in Thomas' death.[Source](http://www.wyff4.com/article/thrown-rock-kills-upstate-woman-teens-charged/6992329)&gt;A jury Thursday night found a man guilty of first-degree murder in the death a woman riding in a sport utility vehicle that was struck by a 10-pound rock dropped from an Interstate 75 overpass.[Source](http://www.iclassifiedsnetwork.com/contentitem/65708/1259/man-found-guilty-of-firstdegree-murder-in-rockthrowing-death)With that said, it appears that neither [North Carolina](http://statelaws.findlaw.com/north-carolina-law/north-carolina-first-degree-murder-laws.html) or [Tennessee](http://statelaws.findlaw.com/tennessee-law/tennessee-first-degree-murder.html) have encompassed the [depraved-heart murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depraved-heart_murder) standard for first-degree murder in their murder statutes. There may be something in their respective common law that does. Either way, the above two news articles show instances where people have been charged, and at least one found guilty as shown by the Tennessee case, for first-degree murder in throwing rocks at vehicles.The repetition of the throwing of heavy blunt objects into an active roadway shows premeditation. If they did it once maybe not premeditated. But they did it several times. In the legal world, this is what's called [depraved-heart murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depraved-heart_murder). It's when you do something substantially likely to seriously injure or kill a person with reckless and calloused indifference for human life.I don't know if it should apply in this particular case or not, but that's the basis for the charge.Negligent Homicide?It's not negligence to throw a rock off an overpass. That's malice.Malicious Homicide? Is that a thing?No. Second Degree murder is though.Negligent homicide implies "accident". It was no accident that threw the rock off the overpass. It was intentional and malicious. They didn't honestly believe "it won't hurt anything"; they were *seeking to cause trouble by doing what they knew to be illegal*, and someone died as a result. They're lucky more people didn't die; they hit four other cars. That's second degree murder. Yes. It's called murder.Isn't it manslaughter, then?Nope, manslaughter is an accident. A *reasonable* person would believe that throwing a rock off an overpass has a good chance of causing serious injury or death, so the murder charge is appropriate. Manslaughter is "less culpable than murder". Why are they not culpable to murder here? There was no misunderstanding: They knew damn well what they were doing was illegal and wrong and malicious, and someone died for it.That's murder. The fact that they're minors is irrelevant to the charges, only relevant to the punishment. If a 35 year old had done this, no one would blink at a murder charge. The crime itself is what's relevant and the DA obviously feels murder is a charge they can successfully argue. Likely a plea deal will be reached for all 5 teens for manslaughter 1.  What is going to be the major issue is if they are charged as juveniles or adults.  If any are 18 or older, they are going away for a long time.  If they are 13 or 14, probably will be out sometime between 18-21.&gt;If they are 13 or 14, probably will be out sometime between 18-21.Does that help? I mean (and other people on this thread are saying the same exact thing) kids that age don't really have the logical capacity to examine the consequences of their actions.I really don't see how sending them away to a juvenile detention center makes the situation any better. And it sucks that this young man lost his life and a kid is now father-less, but I don't see any good taking these kids out of their education now and forcing them to be surrounded by other, more violent figures. Something needs to be done, but if this honestly was an idiotic mistake, multiple years away from family, education and a felony charge that stay on their record for life is certainly not the solution. You think people should just be let go after killing someone because it might mess them up? Really?Sorry but murder is serious enough that even children need to be put away. If you want someone to blame take aim at their parents that didn't teach them right from wrong and didn't supervise them, allowing them to commit the act.As much as it sucks for a human to have their entire life taken away at a young age, their actions destroyed another family in a much worse way.The solution is unequivocally prison, and hopefully this is a harsh lesson and reminder to other idiot kids.&gt;You think people should just be let go after killing someone because it might mess them up? Really?No, I think they need really serious help, like they should be forced to see a psychologist for a few years. And there family life should be evaluated as well by the same method. &gt;Sorry but murder is serious enough that even children need to be put away. If you want someone to blame take aim at their parents that didn't teach them right from wrong and didn't supervise them, allowing them to commit the act.I'm not going to blame the parents because we don't know any of the specific details of this situation... Maybe the parents are forced to work 60 hours a week just to have enough to get by and while they want to be better parents, they aren't afforded that opportunity because of their circumstances. &gt;As much as it sucks for a human to have their entire life taken away at a young age, their actions destroyed another family in a much worse way.So let's ruin another family while we're at it? Eye for an eye they say? &gt;The solution is unequivocally prison, and hopefully this is a harsh lesson and reminder to other idiot kids.Back to my original point, throw the kids into kid-jail, they'll come out as even worse people, possibly even more violent...We need to be looking for a solution, not a hot plate to put it onhttp://www.abc12.com/content/news/5-teenagers-from-Clio-charged-with-murder-in-I-75-rock-throwing-case-452551823.html&gt; One of the suspects is 17, while the other four are younger. There's also a possibility they all can be charged as adult and get life in jail.Benny climbed up on a footbridge and he teetered on the parapet.He said, 'can you see the whites of their headlights are they coming yet?'Who needs information this high off the ground...?damn I feel [old](https://youtu.be/2LqO43QYz08?t=871)..I hope they have better luck than those kids in Sleepers.They'd better be looking at 20 counts of attempted murder on top of that, jesus fuck.Something like this happened when I lived in Germany. My family moved from Wiesbaden to Hanau, and a few months later some American kids were arrested in Wiesbaden for throwing big rocks off an overpass, killing a German woman (who I think had a baby in the car? This was like 20 years ago). It was weird because it was an overpass I had walked over tonsof times, and while I didn't know the kids, I knew people who did.Kids are stupidBloke came in to work today and said someone did this with a brick to his van whilst he was driving home. Mans lucky to be alive This is what happens when idiots decide to have children We have no idea whether the parents are idiots, nor whether they *decided* to have childrenyou can't accidentally give birth pregnancy termination is pretty cheap these days (and highly recommended)You can knowingly do something without it being an accident and without deciding to. When tickled, I squirm. The squirming isn't an accident, and I also don't make a decision to squirm. Yeah but you also can decide to terminate the pregnancy it's not like you don't have a decisionyou don't decide to get pregnant but you certainly decide to give birthand abortions before 10 weeks are as simple as taking two pillsYes you can decide to terminate the pregnancy, yes decisions can be made. And also if no decision is made, a birth typically happens. Not if the parents belonged to religion that are anti-abortion or if the parent are pro-life.You cannot accidentally have a child, and it's highly likely their parents are terrible parents. Wait, did I miss the sex Ed class that says you have to want to become pregnant to become pregnant? He's talking about abortion.Between birth control, prophylactics, abortion, and adoption, no one is forced to have a child.Wait, adoption is a contraceptive?That answer doesn't refute the comment you were responding to.  No one forces you to trip (unless a prank is being played on you which is also theoretically possible with your chosen birth control method), but it still happens unintentionally, as does pregnancy.  Abortions get harder to obtain every day thanks to GOP efforts, and if a child is adopted right away, great, but otherwise, I'd say that growing up in the foster system can be just as bad as being raised by idiot parents.We don't live in the stone age any more. We know exactly how conception occurs and how to prevent it. And even if conception does occur by accident (condom breaks etc), there are medical and legal interventions available to rectify the situation. My wife was a foster child. While it's true that foster care is no picnic, it is better than being with a parent that doesn't want you or is unable or unwilling to provide you the care you need. &gt; highly likely their parents are terrible parents.So all bad actions are the result of bad parents? When do we stop blaming the parents, at 18? 25? 50? You say it's "highly likely", what gives you that notion and when does it stop?Were Manson's parents to blame? Stephen Paddock's? The Slenderman girls? No. I was a malicious little shit as a kid too, my parents were amazing. I was lucky and luckier still never to have hurt anyone, but I was a malicious little shit. Making sweeping generalizations about parents is just letting people ignore the fact that they don't have all the answers, and most illogical things -- definitively -- don't fit when you apply logic to them. People want to understand to feel safe, but the fact is all anyone here is doing is dismissing with prejudice. And oh, subtly imply "I'm *smart*, *I* would've done things to prevent this, were *I* their parent".The logic is terribly flawed anyway: It basically states "smart people don't commit violent crimes". Which has never, ever, ever been true. Arguably the biggest atrocities in history were predicated on very intelligent people's actions and decisions and forethought. You can get pregnant unintentionally. If you then make no decision at all, a baby will be born. No decision IS a decision. Well that's just not true. I couldn't decide what to have for dinner last night and before I knew it, hours of browsing Yelp had passed. I did not make a decision to not eat, it just happened due to lack of decision. &gt; *You cannot accidentally have a child*That's news to me! I guess they lied to me when they said condoms and birth control fail. Thanks for setting me straight. /sInb4 abortion. Abortion access varies based upon the state. So it's a shitty thing to rely on. Getting pregnant ≠ having a childMy parents are great parents, and I was a terrible child.  However, I am now a productive high value citizen.  These kids will be fine.  Throw them in prison for a while and if they don't come out on top,it was never meant to be and we can dispose of them.Says the opinionated person with no kids Legit grew up with terrible parents. My father could gaslight anyone and my mother was depressed and had a habit of trying to pull everyone down with her. I figured out how to feed myself and had to work from 12 on if I wanted to eat anything normal. We had no electrical outlet plates, bare Sheetrock walls, no 2nd floor heat and subfloors as regular flooring. My parents didn’t once ask if I did my homework or even if I went to school. I knew better than to throw a rock off an overpass. My cousin who grew up similar to me, but with an Uber strict (albeit caring) mother and a drunk father would definitely have done something this dumb. The kids I knew who had the wholesome parents, the ones that were there for every life event, enrolled them in sports and bought nice clothes were far more likely to do something like this than I was as well. They had phenomenal parents who cared deeply and worked hard not just to provide, but to be there for their kids emotionally. What is the point of what I’m writing? It isn’t always the parents fault. It can sometimes be attributed, sometimes it can’t. A blanket statement like yours might feel good. But we don’t know if these kids had good or bad parents. We don’t know if one started it and the rest just followed suit. Blanket blaming parents is easy. Don’t take the easy path. There are a million things that could fuel adolescents to do something as shitty as this. None of them are good reasons but they certainly aren’t guaranteed to be results of their parenting. No good parent has ever had a kid do something incredibly thoughtless or stupid. Ever. And the _good people_ all have _wonderful parents. Your posting history suggests your parents are semi-literate inbreds, am I correct in that assumption?for all we know the parents could have been decent and they just happened to be little shitsAs sad as it is, stories like this should be heard nationwide to prevent more accidents like this from happening.Doesn't really seem like an accident...Definitely, I say "accident" extremely loosely.All these comments feel like an episode of Law and OrderI think a just sentence would be putting them in a car going 70mph and having people throw rocks at them&gt;Authorities said four other cars were struck with large rocks and were waiting for police to arrive when the van was hit. No other injuries were reported.So, first one, then two, then three and finally four other drivers got hit and then just sat there waiting for police to arrive rather than doing anything at all to protect others.  Didn't any of them get the idea to just back up in the emergency lane and try to warn other drivers or even block the freeway?  The price of doing nothing was a father's life.  What's the matter with us that when something goes wrong we just look for someone cloaked in authority to fix it? At that time no one understood what was going on and no one had the foresight to warn oncoming traffic the bridge could be crumbling or something. It took police a while to figure out it was all rock tossing "prank" that damaged a few cars and killed one person.You're driving under an overpass and a large rock hits your car and you don't know somebody up there is throwing stuff off the overpass?  Seriously?That's fucked up. Does Michigan have the death penalty?No first state to abolish it in 1847, but they are being charged with second degree murder which never carries the death penalty.5 black teens murder a white man in cold blood. Why is this not a hate crime?Because race isn't a factor here, no matter how hard you try to shoehorn it in.These kids are bloody idiots, and *murderous* bloody idiots now, but they weren't specifically targeting people by race, unless you have some information that the news article doesn't. They were throwing rocks at random cars.What are you going on about? All five teens are white.I think murder charges  are a little much. I think manslaughter would be more appropriate.

And yet even as I type this, I totally believe that this journalist was murdered by Putin.Looks like the polonium coffee isn't acting fast enough for Putin's taste.Po coffee is for export only.  If you're gonna be in Russia you may as well go with knives.  They're cheaper.Good point..........I didn't mean for that to be a pun.Fuck me. I listened to a program with her as a host just yesterday. I actually like her a lot.This country is fucking sick, Jesus Christ.Please get well.Self inflicted?Yeah, and the paper then published her suicide note along with notice they will no longer be a newspaper."We realized we are Fake News. Sad."sounds vaguely familiar...Fell on her own knife!Cut herself shaving.9 times, tragic. USA will be like this soon, and most Americans are too stupid or apathetic to prevent it.Lovely country. And that's the direction the POTUS is pushing his supporters in too. I'm surprised american journalists haven't been killed in the name of "fake news" on home soil.Not yet it'll take a few yearsI'm sure the metal gymnastics are well underway.Trump Supporters love Putin, many even hail him as this freedom fighter and a Patriot.Da, comrade Putin is true American. More American then the George Bush. This will no doubt be happening in the US shortly.  Ok buddy. We already have actual politicians body slamming journalists and going on to win an election. It's really not that hard to imagine what comes next.We have already seen Mr. Trump calling for violence against reporters in a Tweet.  This is where that directly leads.  We're supposed to pretend Trump has nothing to do with any violence coming from his orders and 'suggestions' to maim and kill his detractors. Just like Russian shills pretend Putin's hands aren't covered in innocent blood.I haven't seen this. Can you provide a source?[Here's one instance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/02/trump-body-slam-cnn-tweet-violence-reporters-wrestlemania); I am sure there are many others.I'm sorry, but this is not "calling for violence". Anything else?Sure it is.  Do you any exculpatory evidence that Trump has not exhibited animus to journalists?  This type of behavior is only going to get worse if unchecked.No, it's not. I'm not interested in defending Donald Trump or his treatment of journalists, but I can't not point out how stupid that accusation is.The accusation is not stupid just because you may think it is as your point is not proven.  We have seen how steadily this so called administration has allowed things to slide.  His contempt for journalism has included expressing a desire to yank a network's "license", and having the press corps disparaged on a daily basis from the press room by the press secretary.  Of course, all of this has been seen before.  This same thing happened in Russia 16 years ago.  Now they have little independent journalism left to disparage, discredit, and demean.  Putin turned their journalism into a reality TV show.  Oddly enough, they have a reality TV star on the ballot for the presidency.  There truly is nothing like those made for TV moments we all know and love.  It is fun to watch TV, and it tells us everything we need to know, right?he also wants to "revoke licenses" of media he doesnt like I agree that that's disturbing, but it's nothing near "calling for violence".I agree that this is not evidence. Is this administration looking more and more like the WWE daily? Yeah. But not in this case. I haven’t seen the altercation first hand or seen video of it so I can’t comment either way, but I know if someone was barring my way and being threatening, I’d toss them out of my way too. That's indeed a horrible tragedy, now let's watch Reddit turn it into jokes and propaganda for internet-points.The problem is that it's an expected tragedy.When Vlad is likely involved as the originator of the deaths of many Russian journalists, that's how it goes!Clean up your system or deal with the wide spread mockery.Mockery in the form of memes and therefore normalizing the routine outrages perpetrated by the Russian government.Meanwhile Putin probably doesn't care what people are saying about him on Reddit.&gt; Meanwhile Putin probably doesn't care what people are saying about him on Reddit.He might.  He might not.  But Vlad certainly has someone assigned to judge his popularity on social media, probably a whole team of people.Vlad wants to win, don't he?He wants to remain in power and sow chaos in the US and Europe. Letting Americans make jokes about (and generally accept) that he's capable of assassinating anyone and call it an accident or suicide only helps bolster his position. He doesn't even need to do anything, we're doing the work for him.&gt; Letting Americans make jokes about (and generally accept) that he's capable of assassinating anyone and call it an accident or suicide only helps bolster his position.Nope.  No one is accepting anything.  Sorry but you don't seem familiar with how the USA works.  Our humor is often the first means of creating fissures.  Humor is part of our condemnation.If that doesn't make sense to you, I'm sorry, but that is how it is.Well here's a question for ya. What could redditors do? I mean we aren't in government so we soon by talky have any power. We could have outrage and protests but lets not forget we have our fair share of Russia haters who couldn't care less about this. And Putin is looked upon favorably by a pretty significant portion of Russians. Our condemnation of him doesn't matter. It's up to Russians to give a shit. Although i do agree its fucking terribleWhy not? Plenty of dictators doThat wacky Russia!What crazzzy misadventures will Putin and his friends go through! Find out in the all new sitcom “Putin and friends”, right after the Season Finale of “Trump and Mike’s troublesome times!”only on Disney channel*Mickey Mouse Chortle*“I am trump, believe me, and you are watching Disney Channel, the greatest channel.”Ah yes, nothing says 'propaganda' like criticizing something Russia actually fucking did for the reasons they actually fucking did it. Crawl back under your rock, troll.Don't say shit about Putin, he the US president you know. I love how the corruption is so blatantly obvious. &gt;Russian authorities named the attacker as Boris Gritsok, that's an *awesome* name thoughAs usual the anti Russia circlejerk pretty much makes any comment chain related to Russia unreadable and stops any discussion.
Anti-human smuggling operation? Or anti human-smuggling operation?it was a Goa'uld operation. People being freed from slavery is always good news Yeah right. Some Russian and Ukrainian whores, who paid good money to be smuggled into Turkey, are going to be sent back. Do you think they'll get refunds?I mean they probably got smuggled under the impression they were going to get an actual job and instead were about to be forced into prostitution. So even if they don't get refunds its probably for the best.That's the tear-inducing story they always tell when caught by the police: "they promised I'll work as a housemaid, and then they forced me into prostitution!"That's not how it works. Pimping is an illegal *business*. They are there to make money. Why spend money on guards, worry that girls run away or rat them to the police, when there is no shortage of women perfectly willing to work as prostitutes.&gt; Why spend money on guards, worry that girls run away or rat them to the police, when there is no shortage of women perfectly willing to work as prostitutes.You don't have to worry about them running away when you ship them off to a country in which they don't really speak the same language or have any friends in said country. Maybe ratting them out to police but they can probably instill enough fear in them before they force them to work the streets that they don't go to the police. If they were there to work as housemaids you don't need to smuggle them and if they are willing to work in prostitution they probably wouldn't flee their homeland considering it would be illegal in both places. &gt; there is no shortage of women perfectly willing to work as prostitutes.Only in the porn you watch.I'm not sure you're right, but I'm rethinking my position.Jesus Debbie downer I really hope they just really laid on the sarcasm and it wasn’t brought through the screen Nah, he's just a shitty personYou sound like a truly horrible person.Pro- human trafficking. That's new, yikes.I'm not pro-human trafficking. I'm asserting these girls were willful employees in these brothels (unless proven otherwise, and there's no indication), and should be dealt with as such. E.g. deported or jailed, and whoever smuggled them should be punished as well.This is the answer to all illegal migration, btw. Presenting them as "slaves" and victims is a distortion for socio-political reasons only.So glad to hear this. All these people now have the chance to live their own lives and no longer have to live under the control of others. I can't even imagine how you would go back to a normal life after going through that.When I started my day, I read about 128 people having their life taken from them, ending my day, I get to read about 251 getting their life back. I'll say today has netted more good than bad. The president of this backwards country is Trump's friend. Really makes you think.Turkey is actually a rather beautiful country, filled with the kindest of people. It's unfortunate that they currently have a terrible leader, but then so does America. I guess we could call the US a "backwards country" right now, too, but that's slander against the majority of good people who live here, right? The same is true of Turkey. Use your brain. Think hard.I think there is a big difference between 'friend' and 'not openly hostile'. Is now really the best time to start shit with another Arab/European country?They actually do have a close relationship (or at least had one for many years before Trump took office), however that's neither here nor their. Peachman is just projecting hate into some genuinely good news and deserves to be called a needless rabble rouser for it. Also, fun fact: Turks aren't Arabs. Hell, in some parts of Turkey, Arabs have about as bad a reputation as an ethnic demographic can have. What the fuck does that have to do with anything?  Are you upset that the police, under the authority of Trump's friend, rescued hundreds of trafficking victims?  Fuck TrumpHe's your president and he's doing a great job, it sucks to be a Trump hater huh?Trump Iz BaD, huH guis!?!Yep, he is. Back to the story Jimmy...
A childhood friend of mine is an assistant to a very high level publicist. They were at a major film festival and a very famous 'married' actor was hitting on her big time.So she went *"what the hell I'll never get a chance to bang a famous celebrity,"* (he is good looking, and she is single) so they go back up to his hotel room, and before they can have sex he made her sign an NDA.She did say it kinda killed the mood.. but she went for it anyways.. and he was so drunk he ended up passing out before they could complete "*the deed*." She left unimpressed.Crazy world.LMAO how does that even work?Like[,](https://imgur.com/cXA7XxW) how do you go from sexytime to lawyer back to sexytimes? "Alright Jenny before you take off your pants Ima need you to sign these forms"&gt; Like, how do you go from sexytime to lawyer back to sexytimes?What's funny is at some point in the timeline the actor had to have asked his lawyer for the paperwork.. in case he was going to fuck someone *who is not his wife*.Ahhh.. Hollywood..And now in my mind I can hear the little whirring sound of the printer as it's printing off the NDAs as part of his business trip packing.I don't know why I click it almost every time, but I still do.It probably went [something like this](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/jwmvxd/chappelle-s-show-love-contract).Also, happy cake day!Just roleplay the lawyer. So, this guy not only carries condoms but a stack of NDAs with him. Crazy.. wonder if his wife knows. I hope so. His wife probably has her own. You're probably right! Then what's the point of marriage?? For the kids I guess. So both parents can screw them up too!!  Open marriages are a thing.  Not saying that is what is happening here, but they do exist.[relevant](https://vimeo.com/183089808) Definitely Mark Wahlberg.&gt; Definitely Mark Wahlberg.For the record.. wasn't Mark Wahlberg. But everybody here knows the celeb.I won't say because I don't want to cause any shit.. I just thought it was fucking funny that **he had the paperwork standing by** in case of this very situation.I bet there are many people here who wouldn't know the name if you said it. No celebrity is universally known, no matter how famous they think they are.Morgan Freeman.Thats the black guy that does voice overs on visa commercials right?An African American fellow whose freckles are said to pre-date solar constellations.&gt; No celebrity is universally known, no matter how famous they think they are.Donald Trump, sadly.&gt; No celebrity is universally known..True. He may not be known in Rangoon but he's definitely known in the USA. ;)You've got to say who it is. Yeah. ***You*** didn't sign the NDA, which is probably not enforceable anyway.Derek Jeter had the same thing.  As well as gift baskets to give away in the morning.Since there is no way to prove consent without a written agreement, why would anyone want to endanger oneself? I doubt high-rollers take a shit without running it by their lawyer."Honey, why do you have an NDA with LEXUS SMITH...and CHANTELLE SANDERS...and SUCKY MCFOCK???...and..."What Weinstein did was clearly illegal. NDAs cannot compel you to hide illegal actions.   That isn't a legal contract. So the NDAs are kinda irrelevant. If they can intimidate people, they serve their purpose.So, my question is, what exactly is it that these NDA's are saying? Because if you're trying to hide illegal activity, it seems like a bad idea to have a paper trail. the NDA and the payout are likely worded to say everything was consensual. That's a pretty big over generalization. An NDA probably can't prevent you from reporting a crime or testifying, but in almost all other respects it can prevent public or private statements regarding the subject matter of the NDA, regardless of whether there's criminal behavior involved.There was a great post a year ago about a kid who said I am going on vacation thanks to Company X because of an 130k settlement and the dad have to give the money back because the NDA said he couldn't tell anyone including his family.  Yes, he was a principal at a Florida school. His daughter boasted about it on social media. And I think it was only 80k. One of the many downfalls caused by terrible judgement in sm disclosures!! Btw that girl is a lawyer now I'm pretty sure. LOL.She was a barista at Starbucks at the time while in college . I know because it was down the street from me. That was in 2013. Not sure if she's a lawyer now though. She was a junior at the time, it would be possible she went straight to law school. hahaha the perfect ending to a perfect story. &gt; the dad have to give the money back because the NDA said he couldn't tell anyone including his family.I don't think I would give it back in that situation.I mean he got money and had to sign an NDA. He has to give it back because it was a condition of the settlement.  You don't really have a choice. You're contractually obligated toI would sue on the grounds that I did not explicitly reveal the contents of the NDA, and I was not the one that made my settlement public. It doesn't take a rocket surgeon to deduce that Daddy was working somewhere, now he's not, now his bank account is bigger and he's taking us on vacation.Also, NDAs are borderline unenforceable anyway.This is what I don't get, it's a mutual out of court settlement. They pay you and you don't talk, bring them to trial if you don't like it. Everybody keeps saying they don't know why he wasn't taken down before but every person accepted a settlement rather than go to trial, what do you expect. &gt; Harvey Weinstein. Bill O’Reilly. Roger Ailes. Bill Cosby. The Catholic church.Jesus. America voted for a guy recorded saying "Grab her by the pussy" but he isn't even listed here?     &gt; All were able to skirt years and sometimes decades of allegations of sexual harassment or assault through the use of settlements or contracts that included nondisclosure agreements    Yes, it is called hush money and you do not have to take it. Trump's wives have all signed NDAs. NDAs aren’t worth the paper their printed on on most cases. People will try to scare you with “You signed an NDA”, in most cases it doesn’t hold water.Please explain....Well if one were trying to keep one's daughter as far from Daddy as possible and still afford to send her to the best schools one might keep one's mouth shut, especially since he's well known as a welsher and cheat.(Oh shoot, I gotta go look up if I'm maligning the Welsh.)so have clinton's victims. they forgot to get Tripp to sign one though. And Monica L....she spoke up recently.Even the one who was literally raped over a bad hair transplant.&gt;Jesus. America voted for a guy recorded saying "Grab her by the pussy" but he isn't even listed here?He did say they let him. Hush, it was clearly her internalized gynophobia speaking.I'd like to nominate you for President of Uptopia, where you have complete control.Everyone has secrets, good or bad, and the only way anybody seems capable of keeping secrets *secret* is when you pay them. I'm sure it's really easy is start throwing a few asterisks and addendums onto an employee's contract, and if you're an asshole, a few unfair ones too just because you can.NDAs should not cover illegal activity.They don't. But in the NDA they can say "under sound body and mind this is what happened and I wont talk about it." Then later you say the truth you said in a legal document what "happened" and that you signed an NDA. Something like "under sound body and mind me and mr X sat in a room and talked about baseball cards for 20 minutes"  Hollywood has long been a weird place in this regard. For exampleI got the feeling that when the Mel Gibson tapes came out that he had some kind of “additional” contract with his wife where she was supposed to “blow him” on a regular basis.anything that forces you to not talk about something illegal should be null and void.  you keep the money and get to blab.They can't force you to not talk about something illegal. It'd be very weird if they could since you could just break any law that you please.NDA's are pretty worthless.  They are not. I want to comment on this but I signed a NDA. Pretty much every NDA I've ever signed was explicit about you not being able to mention the existence of an NDA. I want to comment on this but I can't, for legal reasons. (is that better?)[SP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWKKI2ky8w)This is nonsense. NDA's are superseded by law. Confidential information that's material in a crime can and should be turned over to authorities. 
Beginning of the article:&gt;WASHINGTON — The Drug Enforcement Administration has for five years steadfastly defended the behavior of its agents in a late-night drug seizure carried out with Honduran forces on the remote Mosquito Coast, a mission that resulted in the deaths of four Honduran civilians.&gt;In the D.E.A.’s view, the dead — one man, two women and a 14-year-old boy — were among those on a boat that shot at a canoe carrying a joint D.E.A.-Honduran antidrug team. The D.E.A. said it had evidence in the form of night-vision video taken from a surveillance plane showing an “exchange of gunfire” between the two vessels after the larger boat collided with the canoe carrying the agents.&gt;Now, for the first time, the three-hour video has been released to the public. It strongly suggests that the D.E.A.’s account of crossfire in the May 2012 mission was not accurate. The release of the video, under a Freedom of Information Act request, follows a scathing report published by the inspectors general of the departments of Justice and State earlier this year that challenged the D.E.A.’s version of events.&gt;The video shows numerous flashes of light consistent with gunshots originating from the antidrug unit, according to Bruce Koenig, a forensic expert hired by ProPublica and The New York Times to analyze the images.&gt;Mr. Koenig, who formerly was supervisor of the F.B.I.’s forensic audio/video group, examined the video frame by frame and concluded that only one flash originates from the passenger boat. In Mr. Koenig’s view, that flash could have been caused by a bullet striking the engine, which was later found to have a bullet hole. Infrared cameras detect heat and turn it into bright spots on video, so a muzzle flash from a gunshot and a spark from a bullet ricocheting off a metal surface can create similar flares.&gt;The controversy over the actions of the agents has had an impact: As the D.E.A. braced for the May release of the inspectors general report on the episode, the agency disbanded the program that had run the interdiction operation, named the Foreign-deployed Advisory Support Teams, or FAST. The FAST program provided military-style training to law enforcement officers in other countries to counter drug traffickers.&gt;The inspectors general report, which found no evidence to support the D.E.A.’s account that its agents were fired upon, has also drawn attention from lawmakers. A bipartisan group of four senators asserted that the D.E.A. and State Department “repeatedly and knowingly misled members of Congress and congressional staff.”&gt;“The D.E.A. convinced themselves of a false version of events due to arrogance, false assumptions, and ignorance,” said Tim Rieser, an aide to Sen. Patrick Leahy and one of the staff members who has spent years delving into the shooting. “They rushed to judgment and then stuck to their story.”Lol at the DEA paddling around in a canoeOne thing is certain, I'm glad there is video.you know how some republicans get giddy when some politicians recommend eliminating the EPA? I would feel the same way about the DEA. Good riddance.Can we PLEASE just abolish the DEA already?I heard an argument against closing it last year that was simply "but that'd make people lose jobs".Their work fucking loses us money, lives,and morality. They literally shouldn't have those jobs.Sounds like the epitome of a bad-faith argument.  I'd bet good money their goalposts would shift if you dismantled the 'jobs' argument.  Same with the tea.$12-16/hr jobs + benefits keeping up thousands of uneducated, unskilled Americans.It's like Wal-Mart but full time did you mean TSA or is this an alphabet soup I'm not familiar withNew phone, auto corrected TSA to teathat's the closest thing there is to a cogent argument in favor of the DEA lolbetween local cops, the FBI and the ATF, the DEA is pretty much a redundant administrationTake the ATF with themAdd TSA to that dumpster express.The D.E.A. are one of the least trusted agencies in the states. At this point, I have no reason to trust their word on *anything*. If they ever release a statement, I just have to automatically assume it's either a half-truth or outright lie.The DEA is a drug cartel nestled inside our government.Cowards and crooks. Gotta fund black ops somehow.It's and has always been a starting point for new malleable prosecutors looking to start a family.Add border patrol to the top of that list&gt; Mary Brandenberger, a D.E.A. spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether the agency still believed that an exchange of gunfire had taken place, because the episode was still under internal review.Someone still has their head up their ass!She doesn't have her head up her ass.  She just seeks to avoid any possible accountability for DEA agents for killing 4 innocent persons.  It's far worse than ignorance.  It's intentional obfuscation and delay to cover up wrongdoing.Government narrative once again foiled by a FOIA request! Transparency, transparency, transparency.It's the only hope to hold government accountable.  The cockroaches run when the light is shed upon them.The DEA being shitty? I could not believe it.Fuck the DEA. They need to be abolished.Good thing the D.E.A. is still around. Totally worth paying all those salaries to keep winning the endless war on drugs. &gt; Totally worth paying all those salaries to keep ~~winning~~ the endless war on drugs going strong..there, FIFY..or.. maybe I have my alphabet agencies wrong.. isn't it the CIA that keeps the "war" going with their smuggling ops?  while the DEA looks the other way.If you watch the video you can see that they do not open fire until a water taxi rams their disabled boat. Furthermore two of the three officers involved were Hondurans, so this wasn't just three DEA agents opening fire at random as the headline might suggest. They had taken over a small boat that they knew to be laden with cocaine and that boat had become disabled. This water taxi comes around the bend, panics apparently due to the helicopters, and make a b-line of the boat. The officers open fire as the taxi rams them. I could see how they thought they were under attack. I don't see why the need to lie about it.   You say "ram" as if the passenger boat did it on purpose.  Crash is more of an accurate term for it don't you think?  It's kinda like how the USS Fitzgerald and USS McCain got "crashed" into by those two merchant ships in the dead of night.  Crashed is fine, but we're still talking about 3 officers in a drug interdiction operation being "run into" by another boat at a decent speed at night. You'd have to be pretty fucking telepathic to know it was a water taxi in those circumstances. I could see how they thought they were under attack. Plus when you watch the video you can see the Taxi change course in their direction, which is why I chose to say ram. When I was 12 yrs. old I was *trained* in hunter's safety.  We were taught to not shoot at shadows and to know where our bullets were going.  It seems to me the cops these days are being trained to fear for their lives and empty their guns at the drop of a hat while disregarding what or who is in the crossfire.   If the DEA said looking at the sun was dangerous, I'd personally have to do a Donald Trump before I'd trust them at their word.There's a reason that I don't trust a damn word of what the US government says.How about you leave them alone?Fuck the dea. Shut it down, put all of them in the welfare lineDrug enforcement agents lying?  Never!Poor Hondurans aren't safe in america. If only there was a country just for Hondurans A part of Trump's agency lying to protect its ass? Tell me it ain't so!This happened back in 2012... Nice try though. Trump in 2012?  Sup ShitTroll. Corrupt government long pre-dates Trump.[deleted]English hard
"According to a Montreal bylaw, “to cause disorder by screaming” violates “peace and tranquility”"How loud was he singing?I am imagining him screaming My Chemical Romance lyrics while stopped at a stoplight next to a cop or somethingNo, it was "EVERYBODY DANCE NOW"I thought you were kidding, but it literally is this song hahahahaI can kind of see how they might have thought someone was screaming if he was singing that one badly. And here I was hoping it for "fuck da police".I was hoping for Anal Cunt.No, it was Skrillex- Equinox. "CALL 9-1-1 NOW!"Nope....had to be Devil Wears Prada screaming...Most rock music or challenging pop music basically requires you to sing at the top of your lungs to hit high notes. A car is practically the only place you can do that without bothering people if you live in an apartment.Death Grips isn't for everyoneBlo blo blo blo blo blo oh no hot head10 9 8 7 triple 6 5 forked tongue!It goes it goes it goes it goes it goes YAH! His Singing was bad. Montreal man did nothing wrong.Agreed. Bad singing is not a municipal bylaw as far as I know. https://youtu.be/CCVdQ8xXBfk?t=9Could be doing harsh vox for a metal band lmaoHis wife is fucking savage.I know. Stand by your man and all of that, huh?[removed]I mean, supporting your partner isn't something that's verboten in Feminism. However, sometimes supporting your partner means letting them know when they're being an asshat. You really get the impression that these two have had this argument before, lol.My bad, I was just being flippant.I would agree the he crossed the line of courteous restraint when he publicly embarrassed her in front of a cop.Fred Savage?This is the most Canadian article ever. A ticket for rather innocuous behavior, he accepted it without him griping and his wife agreeing with the cops. Bullshit. No one said sorry even once. I don't believe it for one second. "Here's your ticket for singing. Sorry". "Yes officer, I understand, so sorry." It's a Canadian news source. Quoting saying sorry by all parties involved is implied.Righto. Sorry. These are French CanadiansOops. Sorry. does that make them not canadians somehow?not the "sorry" kindNo, in fact they're CanadiensAccording to them?  Yes. What do you mean somehow? It's article 4 in the Canadian constitution.I think you're confused. We don't have a constitution and its certainly not article 4 in the charter of rights and freedomsI'm not sure if I'm missing a joke here, but Canada having no constitution would be news to me: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_CanadaEdit: I suppose what you mean is in regards to it being an "amalgamation of codified acts and uncodified traditions and conventions".  There was a big fuss about constitutional changes back in 1982 though (with Justin Trudeau's dad as PM - for those unfamiliar with Canadian history), so it's not unusual to talk about Canada having a constitution.Not missing a joke my bad, I've always heard of it referred to as the charter of rights and freedoms. Regardless, section 4 says nothing about French Canadians not being considered Canadian. Fair enough!That is how it happened.Sorry.Also his go to analogy involves the Habs winning a hockey game.Was fully expecting this to be a link to 'never gonna give you up..'Must have been pretty bad singingHe was singing the brown note, everything was offended.I had my dog in the car once and started singing along with Pink Floyd's *Wish You Were Here*. Damned dog turned her back and buried her nose between the passenger seat and the door. I got the hint and haven't sung since.&gt;Damned dog turned her back and buried her nose between the passenger seat and the door. I got the hint and haven't sung since.Awww...maybe he's not a Floyd fan? Try *Old King* by Neil Young :)He was probably singing in English.  Language police in Quebec don't mess around.  I was certain this comment would be here to upvote. American here, can you elaborate? I get that "language police" is probably sarcasm, but do people in Quebec genuinely get mad at English being spoken?Quebec has government bureaucrats that travel around to ensure that French is the most prominent language on any signage in any business in the province, and that there isn't any English in the names.  A few years back, they tried to force a group of multinationals (Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Costco, Toys R' Us, Old Navy, Gap, Guess and Curves) to change their names so as to be more French, or to include a french slogan on all their signage.  They go around fining people, and generally making nuisances of themselves.  French-speaking Quebecers were treated rather poorly in the old days, so there are a number of older people there nursing old grievances who will support any measure to punish the anglos and protect Quebec's ethnic purity.  They also tend to flood the Quebec French Language Office with complaints, as Quebec's Charter of the French Language can be interpreted quite harshly.  The problem is generally solving themselves as the angry old people die, and young Quebecers who have grown up after the anglo bosses fled Montreal in the 1970s aren't as sensitive as their parents and grandparents.  It's not sarcasm.  It's an actual thing, although the term "language police" is a pejorative.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise But I'm sure the Montreal police will never pull over a Hell's Angels biker for their illegally loud exhausts.When I read the headline I was thinking about coming in here to discuss how driving isn't supposed to fun and it should be taken seriously, it is the most dangerous activity most of participate in on a daily basis after all.  But after reading the article all I can say is this is a load of bullshit and I hope he gets the ticket dismissed.I think the people who are the most dangerous on the road are the rushy jerks who honk and yell at everything and anyone in front of them, and who's impatience generally makes everyone else on the road more aggravated and on-edge. i.e. the *opposite* of the people who sing. We should be *rewarding* this type of behavior, not punishing it.As long as there not too distracted, I mean some folks ***really*** get into it...how can you not do the air drums during the solo?That's what trafic lights are for.I'm just a poor boy, from a poor family ...gotta make that quota!"Sir, we don't have quotas," said the cop, writing another ticket so he wouldn't get fired for not writing enough tickets.  Well maybe he should have read the terms and conditions.If he was singing in English or French only he deserves it...gotta follow the laws, needs to be in both English and FrenchWell he was in Quebec so the French sections had to be 80% louder than the English sections. canadians are weird. they speak french, think theyre british, but really theyre just americans who dont tipdownvote away cold peopleNot gonna lie - if you road trip with me you are going to be subjected to my renditions of Disney's original "Jungle Book" - consequences be damned!This is fucking ridiculous.This sounds like an unusual crazy story but everyday there are dozens, maybe over a hundred tickets given out indirectly because of singing while driving.  Police will look for that and pull over drivers, especially young drivers, then issue a ticket for something else.  Very common.But this instance wasn't indirect. He was given a ticket directly for singing. So while getting pulled over for something simple is very common, this result is anything but. That is what makes this story unusual and crazy.He could have been given the ticket for singing. Human beings tend to think that the world revolves around them. The officer probably noticed the guy emoting, waving his arms around or something, and (incorrectly) assumed the guy was being a smart ass because he saw the cop looking at him. Is this real?? I'm ALWAYS singing in my car. Distracted driving laws.Gotta love them...[A probable rendition](https://soundcloud.com/seanduffyws/gonna-make-you-sweat-everybody)Quebec is a shit province anyways, they act like they're the Texas of Canada. Joke's on him, they were fake cops from Just For Laughs Gags. Probably for driving badly while singingHe was probably super obnoxious about it. These articles never tell the full story. Its news entertainment and not news after all.And you can't compare it to sports games. That's not a fair comparison. Those aren't daily occurrences. We don't need people everywhere being loud and obnoxious daily.You have to sing every other line in FrenchIt is cruel and unusual punishment to hear his tone-deaf singing.&gt;“I said, ‘Okay, thank you,’ because I know I can contest the ticket,” he said. “They were doing their job.”Sadly, this exchange would NEVER happen in the US.Pretty sure the vast majority of tickets issued in the U.S. provoke no verbal altercation whatsoever.  Most people aren't stupid enough to argue with a cop.But then how will you get 7,000 YouTube hits?This lady might disagreehttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RB8katyjc9QCan't really watch that with the sound on where I'm at right now, is she the one that tried to claim she has all the rights of a citizen but doesn't have to follow any of the laws because she's a "Sovereign citizen" or whatever phrase she uses?Yeah, she's a 'citizen of the earth' or something stupid like that.New level of stupid has been attained, would you like to upgrade your character? /s
If I were Japanese, I would be concerned.I don't blame them.I’m glad the Japanese are being tough on North Korea. It’s crazy how people on this site blame the NK escalation in trump. This country has always been a threat and their rthetoric should be treated as such.Meanwhile there's been a ton of propaganda on North Korea while they've been doing elections here, with every politician using it as their soap box almost.Also all of the law and constitution changes being pushed through on the "North Korea could attack us at any minute" reasons.He's had a role, but it would have escalated regardless.trump said some dumb stuff and his followers ate it up "see, now NK will think twice before doing anything....". No, no they won't. trump and kim will both talk loudly with a big stick to appease their followers. Did trump speed things up and possibly alienate any possibility of talks, probably.I wouldn't say Kim does anything to appease anyone. You appease him or workcamp.He very much has the N.K. military leadership to appease.Possibility of talks? Like the ones the US has been attempting for the last ~30 years? Talks were futile from the beginning, and we all but gave up on them entirely during Obama's administration when it became clear that despite commitments from North Korea in exchange for food, they had no intentions of stopping or even slowing their nuclear weapons program. The last 3 presidents have been unsuccessful at dealing with North Korea, and all have played a part at getting us to where we are today. All 3 prior presidents have wanted to keep 'war' off the table and if anything could  be done to not engage in war, that was seen as the better alternative. They were indeed kicking the ball down the road because inciting a war is never a solution. Trump picks up on this and calls the presidents' efforts before him a failure, he has no problem with wiping NK off the map and putting SK and Japan in danger. You might think that this wouldn't have been so bad if NK was dealt with much earlier and you'd be right, but hindsight is always 20/20.Except for the fact that Russia and the former USSR would have prevented us from doing anything for most of that time. Plus we’ve been occupied with Iraq and Afghanistan for a good bit of that time as well. It’s never easy to solve these kind of issues without stirring up some shit somewhere else IMO...Especially without any type of international coalition.&gt;but hindsight is always 20/20Those past 3 presidents knew the dude was going to go for nuclear weapons, "hindsight is 20/20" bullshit isn't going to work here. The past presidents WERE failures. If Trump fires nukes first, then you can blame him if you REALLLLLLY want to try, but by that time, it will probably be the right thing to do. What happens in 10-20 years if they haven't been dealt with yet? They then have the ability to destroy most of the U.S, as well as Japan and South Korea? They will constantly and consistently hold our allies hostage for favors and bargaining chips. I can't believe you think a preemptive nuclear strike is the right thing to do. It will absolutely start WW3 and most of the international community will turn on us. You are out of your mind.What do you expect from Trumpers? This is exactly what they voted for, we have bombs and were going to use them and we don't give 2 shits about the consequences But I thought they couldn't vote for Hillary because she was a war monger who would start WW3.It should of been done 20 years ago, if possible without nuclear weapons, because it wasn't, now we get to play brinksmanship. The thing about a preemptive nuclear strike, is that soon, it's going to be literally the only option outside of diplomacy that we can use to stop them from doing what they want. Soon they'll be exporting nuclear weapons to more of our enemies, developing much stronger nuclear weapons as well as more, and will be able to launch them from anywhere on nuclear armed subs. Hmm the only other option would be diplomacy. Too bad you voted for someone physically incapable of that.  He might literally be the worst person possible to find a diplomatic solution. His ego, low intelligence, and lack of understanding of even how the world operates on a basic level renders that impossible.&gt; alienate any possibility of talks,We've been trying to talk since the 70's.  Insane amounts of heating oil, cash, experts, cash, deals, treaties, cash, agreements, all with the constant broken promises from NK.   They lie every time.  They break their word every time.  The ignore the international community every time.    Also, to say it's "Trump" is pretty misleading.  It's the United Nations.You are a fucking liar. I want true news. I looked up your supposed quote, Trump NEVER said anything like that. In fact, North Korea said that TO HIM!And use some god damn common sense. Trump didn't speed anything up. NK is moving as fast as they can. Their program just happens to be where its at while hes in office, it could have been Sanders if Hillary had not ran and then been hadn't been caught cheating (but you don't care or know about that probably). Put yourself in Kim's shoes. You see the American media crapping all over Trump, thousands of protesters under the delusion that they are going to force Trump out of office by throwing a tantrum. This stuff would not be tolerated in North Korea, the people involved would just be killed. And no, even in America this is not the norm for protests. If you're Kim, you see a divided America and a weak leader who is barely clinging to power.If you're Kim, you decided to take the opportunity to display your own power to force America into concessions by bullying Japan, Guam, etc with threats of nuclear missiles. Go ahead and exercise your right to protest, America. But you should consider that maybe if you hadn't taken it to such an extreme, that Kim wouldn't be pressing his luck right now. **Predators are far more likely to attack enemies they perceive are already wounded.**Don't pretend like your anti-Trump mania hasn't influenced Kim Jong into acting a dick.He can perceive it as a weakness, but it is not.  If he is insane enough to actually use a nuclear weapon on either us or one of our allies...Well, may God have mercy on all of us.Yea...Pretty sure Trump's outlandish remarks had zero influence on Kim's attitude.Then maybe you shouldn't have wounded the country  by attacking half of it. But we all know you don't give a fuck about this country and are just trying to save face like you always do by blaming all your problems on liberals Yea, he should be more like Bill...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5b26wYBeigI don't like Trump, but I don't see what he did wrong. Doesn't matter whether you're diplomatic like Obama or shit talk back like Trump, North Korea will still threaten South Korea, Japan and the US with nuclear weapons. It's the annual shakedown game where they demand food and other kind of aid, otherwise they start some shit. By getting bigger weapons they can make bigger demands. NK won't change this strategy until its neighbors or the US doesn't get bored of it.And trump is handling that threat poorly because he’s a moron.NK's aggressive actions this year can be attributed to the reaction from the Left and the Media to Trump winning the Presidency. Like it or not, he is the president, and America's enemies around the world love to see this country divided against its government. Kim Jong Un would not tolerate media and protesters crapping on him like they do to Trump. Obviously we have the right to protest and that's great, but a lot of people are under the delusion that they're going to force Trump out of office and overthrow an election by throwing a tantrum, "becoming ungovernable", "resisting" etc.  The result of this is that Kim Jong Un sees Trump as very weak, because in Kim's mind a strong leader would not tolerate these sorts of attacks on his rule; Kim would have the protesters jailed or killed,  and the media shut down.Kim thinks American leadership is weak and the country is divided, and he sees this as an opportunity to display his own strength, thinking he can bully America into concessions. And I honestly get the impression that if North Korea nuked Los Angeles, the left would simultaneously blame Trump for not protecting American and insist that Trump not retaliate to defend us. They have this weird double think going on where nothing Trump can possible do can be right.So you're telling me that we should not protest an unqualified and demonstrably incompetent leader because.. it makes us look bad.You know what makes us look worse? Electing Trump in the first place.&gt; unqualified"a presidential candidate must be a natural born citizen of the United States, a resident for 14 years, and 35 years of age or older."Looks like he's qualified.Oh, aren't you a sarcastic little fucker.It's not crazy at all. Trump's management of NK has been abysmal compared to his predecessors. They've been a threat but they had been a contained and marginalized one.They were were "contained" by not having long enough range missiles and enough bombs to use them to hit a US population center, but they've been rapidly remedying that. Yeah threatening nuclear warfare is nothing....He never said that. Can told you that's how to interpret it. You're the type that gIves us on the left a bad name [removed]He never said he'd attack for no reason, he said if North Korea striked.  And you know what, that'd be a given with any country.  Australia threatened war with North Korea even before that if there was an attack You are the idiot.&gt;You are the type of person that gives the human race a bad name.Lol a bad name to whom? The Vulcans? The Vulcans think we're bad? Just who exactly do you identify with? The trees?Don't be a fucking idiot, you're not funny.Somehow, the South Koreans are less concerned.It's only prudent to be concerned, but the Japanese government has, in my opinion, been fear mongering for political gain.They should rearm and take care of the problem.They slowly are, Japan finally broke the 1% spending cap on their military in March of this year. Japan could pretty easily spend 100billion USD on their military and rapidly increase their size. With North Korea and China it is increasingly seeming like they might. They have had a whole bunch of rules put in place after WW2 that are slowly being removed.That's against their constitution. Part of their surrender was them agreeing to a tiny military and that the US would basically protect them. It does need to change and has been slowly but they need to change a fundamental part of their constitution Which is why Japan has the SDF (Self Defense Force).Which is also the 3rd or 4th largest military power in the world (depends on the month).But that part of the Constitution has been constantly under attack for almost a decade now.  With Abe having a large majority in the diet, he's been pushing a lot of stuff through while controlling public perception.  North Korea just gives him something to push it with.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/world/asia/japan-constitution-shinzo-abe-military.htmlThey should probably get on that.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/world/asia/japan-constitution-shinzo-abe-military.htmlLong overdue No way North Korea launches a nuclear weapon unless provoked with military action."No way Japan attacks Pearl Harbor if we just mind our own business."Did anyone say that though? Japan was an expansive imperialist power at the time.The idiot thinks that Imperial Japan trying to expand their control is exactly what NK is doing now...Yeah, because Imperial Japan = modern day North Korea. Get the fuck out of here with that nonsense.Yeah, for one thing Japan had sane and competent leaders Also, Japan had already taken out half of China.  Japan attacking a western power, although not necessarily the US, should not have been a shocking thing.The US was really the only western power they had any reason to attack directly.  We were the ones maintaining an embargo against them, and the ones with a notable fleet in the Pacific.What about the Dutch, or the British?  They were interested in controlling all of the resources in the islands in SE Asia.  I would think they would have had more incentive to attack them, since their was something directly to be gained from it (rubber and or oil).The general assumption I've read is that they wanted to preemptively remove the biggest obstacle in the Pacific (the US Pacific Fleet) before their planned attacks on British, Dutch, and American held territory there.  Just off the top of my head they invaded Indonesia (then Dutch held) within a month of the Pearl Harbor attack.It's not even just that. There are arguments that KJU isn't really all that unstable and just comes off that way to present the image that he could go off at any time. We really don't know.Not to mention that NK is an isolationist country who mainly likes to yell really loud to get cool free stuff from the world's strongest countries. Imperial Japan was blatantly expansionist.Everything we know about KJU is through what our media tells us about him. It's propaganda 101.The guy probably had top level education growing up, and is far from being an idiot.We didn’t mind our own business tho? We cut off their oil supply.  We most certainly were not minding our own business. The US was far from “minding its own business” and like an expansionist empire actively invading countries and an isolated nation are in anyway similar. Get realI think North Korea is a threat and I agree. North Korea wants to sustain itself. Maybe Kim and his generals will be content with building nukes and not do much else for the rest of his life. Then the next guy will come along and have to prove himself to the generals by making North Korea stronger in some way. The successor would have access to a stockpile of nuclear weapons and the black market.What if he decides to sell nuclear bombs to America's enemies in order to build up wealth and influence while disrupting American interests? Imagine the chaos that would ensue if the Taliban or Hezbollah had access to nukes. North Korea has made threats to the world with promises of genocide and complete destruction. It is not a nation that can be trusted to be responsible with nukes.What intelligence are they basing the 'critical imminent threat' on? Unless N.K. are spotted mobilizing their forces and prepping missiles, I wouldn't be worried.The threats, the various nuclear tests, the missiles that flew over the Japanese mainland, the development of a hydrogen bomb... North Korean state agency threatened on Thursday to **use nuclear weapons to “sink” Japan** and reduce the United States to “ashes and darkness” for supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution and sanctions over its latest nuclear test.They've been saying stuff like this forever though. Once a missle flies both near and over your country, I think thats enough.I suppose there are lots of tells, especially these days with satellites and if you can get drones in. There's diplomatic ways as well, things they're telling their people (in countries where they actually have people), things they're trying to buy. Militarily if they're swapping out treads on their tanks, or doing large scale maintenance operations, etc. No idea what they're basing this on like you said. It could be that the way NK is talking to Japan feels different than it has for the last 50 years. That could be enough to get the hairs on the backs of everyone's neck to stand up. &gt; t could be that the way NK is talking to Japan feels different North Korean state agency **threatened on Thursday to use nuclear weapons to “sink” Japan** and reduce the United States to “ashes and darkness” for supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution and sanctions over its latest nuclear test.If we would just quit fucking around and put Solid Snake on the case, this whole shit would be over yesterday.Dude's a pile of organic material at this point, we would have a better chance sending in Ocelot.Honestly we need to figure out how to take down this oppressive empire. I am normally against the USA overthrowing other governments but this instance is different. These people are basically being held hostage by their dictator and brainwashed from birth to believe he is god. We need to find a way to take down the government with as small of loss of life as possible and reeducate the populations so they can finally move past this oppressive time in their history. I am rooting for the North Korean citizens finally having their freedom. Honestly we just need to nuke the NK and call it done.Yeah and let south Korea get all the radiation poisoning. Great idea! Complete lack of empathy towards other humans is the way to go. This is bs. NK ain't gonna do shit. Even still, I can understand the sentiment. It’s not everyday that countries allow ballistic missile to be shot across their sovereign land without repercussions. They are the only country in the world that has been nuked.  They are taking this way more seriously than the majority of grandstanding redditors ("Trump said bad things about North Korea so I don't care about stopping North Korea")&gt; "Trump said bad things about North Korea so I don't care about stopping North Korea"No one is saying that though. What I hear is more like "Instead of having a pissing contest on twitter with Kim Jong Un and pushing us all closer to a nuclear war and Seoul getting wiped off the map, Trump should listen to people who actually understand international diplomacy and warfare so we can do it in a way that minimizes casualties." &gt; No one is saying that though.Except the top comment of this thread to which we are now replying; downplaying what Japan said about NK.That comment doesn't even mention Trump. It's just a prevailing contrarian attitude I've noticed.As opposed to the moronic trumpers who prefer twitter war with a nuclear armed country?He's drawing attention to the issue; starting a dialogue.  I love using an opponent's rhetoric.I’m curious. What in your mind should redditors/US do to demonstrate they are taking NKs threats seriously?I think the general sentiment from reddit is that most are tired of war. Encouraging war as the next natural escalation of two leaders Twitter war is ludicrous. The general sentiment from Reddit is 'fuck anything that appears near the name Trump'. The number of comments that are blaming Trump for being a warmonger that will end the world is astounding, there is another nation literally flying nukes over our allies and Trump is *still* the bad guy. This conflict started more than 50 years ago and every NK thread has people losing their minds about Trump 'starting shit', it is absolutely astounding. Because he's on twitter making stupid statements about it, pushing the conflict in the wrong direction, instead of handling it like an adult. Millions could die because Trump baited another madman into war. This shit matters. Lives are at stake, lots of them. But he's treating it like one of his childish pissing contests with the media. Everyone knows NK is a problem. No one is defending them. But they are in a position to do a ton of damage, and Trump is making it worse. South Korea is likely to get annihilated before this is over because he is treating it like a TV reality show. &gt; Millions could die because Trump baited another madman into war.He baited Kim, the leader of a regime that was hurling missiles over neighbors long before Trump, into war? You mean he isn't appeasing the DPRK anymore and may end up holding the can so many have kicked down the road? Sorry you don't like the brinksmanship but your approach has gotten us here, time to try something new.This is the shit I am talking about, you want to put the blame on Trump rather than the country actually shooting missiles at people. Sorry, we tried the whole appeasement thing and the situation has gotten worse, maybe it is time to show the DPRK that the US will fight for its interests. Regardless, blaming Trump for a war that nearly predates his own birth is asinine.  You do understand that more than one side can be at fault, right? And it's not about *blame*, or whose side has the biggest dick. It's about doing the best thing for the world and the US. It's about doing what causes the least damage.All I'm saying is it's stupid to kick a hornets' nest. You call an exterminator and have them take care of it in a way people don't get stung. We need to do something about NK. But the something we need to do is not bait them into attacking SK. Because of their geographic location and support from China and Russia, we can't just go provoking them. We also can't just attack them without it becoming a massive quagmire. I do love how all the "Hillary's a nutcase who would start WWIII!" folks have pivoted to "Trump should start WWIII!" though. The reason you can't just "show the DPRK that the US will fight for its interests" is because they can wipe out millions of South Koreans before we do that. It's incredibly irresponsible and risky. And if you do make a move on NK, for fuck's sake don't broadcast it on twitter beforehand. So far, Trump has gotten us *closer* to NK nuking someone. His two bit antics are going to get millions killed. They aren't just working on nukes - they already have huge stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and the demilitarized zone is just 40 miles away from Seoul. They have missiles that can reach Tokyo. A military strike endangers a massive number of people *outside* of NK. We also risk a huge backlash from the rest of the world for putting NK's neighbors in such danger. Here are the options, with likely outcomes:Full strike on NK: Kim bombs Seoul out of existence, probably a few other cities. Massive loss of life. Possible WWIII with China and Russia. Limited strike on NK: Same as full strike, most likely.Assassinate Kim: Could work, we probably have the capability to pull it off. But it is against the Geneva convention and could also start WWIII. Be patient: Yes, Kim gets to keep working on nukes. But massive loss of life is avoided for now. We keep trying to work out a diplomatic solution with China and Russia. Yes, it's kicking the can down the road but at least we avoid millions and millions of innocent people dying. Despite the batshit crazy stuff Kim does, NK has shown they won't ensure their own destruction by striking first for no reason. They just saber rattle a lot. It's not a great solution, but it's probably the best available right now. Bait Kim into striking first: It has the same effect as a full or partial strike except gives Kim a lot more time to do damage before we wipe out his capabilities to wreak havoc. It may allow us to destroy NK without starting WWIII, but it would guarantee that tens of millions or hundreds of millions die before we neutralize NK - so not much better. I guess I should be happy I live on the East Coast and not California. Definitely not Seoul or Tokyo. This will all get really fun with NK starts to threaten us about exporting nuclear weapons all across the world, including to terrorists that hate the U.S and don't have nearly as much to lose. So in short..  Be nice and ask them to stop... And talk to the neighbors about your growing concern while they increase their nuclear capabilities till they really can oblitterate SK. Go to some SK forums and see how they feel about this. Alot more advocate action that US citizens bc I think they realize the threat of complete annihilation grows every year now. What happens when Kim gets old and desperate. If he realizes hes dying. We can hope for a coup from the inside but that is litterally the only hope with this plan.&gt; whose side has the biggest dick.There have been studies. And let me tell you NK did not fair too well. Besides their breakthrough to the tough part of nuclear weapomry happenned under Obama. They are just fine tuning/finishing their missiles now.I dunno.. I’m neutral on Trump for the most part. But any time he’s in agreement with John Warmonger McCain, consider me a skeptic. Im glad that Trump has endeavored to engage other nations and implement the toughest sanctions ever, but without Russia/China full support, they are doomed.  Actually going to war with NK before they act on one of their thousand+ prior threats, is where I would withdrawal support. Holy shit, this isn't a "twitter war".  NK is developing nukes and shooting ballistic missiles over Japan, as well as saber-rattling.  The question is whether you are only ok with ignoring it because the alternative is to agree with Trump.  I've read stories about what happens in NK, and although I can't attest to their 100% veracity, I've always questioned why we can intervene in middle eastern countries but ignore NK.  The two answers are, in my opinion: China, and no Oil.  With China backing down a bit due to NK's extreme rhetoric, and with priorities that don't involve handing out government contracts to develop oil fields, I think now may be the time for military action.There are still major problems, such as conventional artillery that will strike South Korea in the event of war; but you have to ask yourself, what would the threat be like if they had nukes?  Can we allow that threat to develop?  I'll tell you right now, if nobody responds to the threat, and NK develops nukes, there will be no possibility of intervention without nuclear war.  Seems like a lose-lose situation, to be honest.  It's basically blood or appeasement.  I'm fine with either path, but there will be consequences that we will be feeling for decades either way.No one is "ok with ignoring it". We're just not ok with pushing a madman into annihilating South Korea by baiting him with stupid shit on twitter. It's a very tense situation. We need a POTUS who handles it like an adult. Like Obama (mind you Im a fan of his) who did pretty much nothing to stop NK from getting nukes? NK does not respond to diplomacy, nor are they deserving of it. An unstable dictatorship with nukes is a terrible recipe. Even if they never plan to use them, they could sell them to terrorists, or lose some of them (now or when the country falls).&gt; An unstable dictatorship with nukes is a terrible recipe.You just described how the world feels about Trump. You're right, NK doesn't respond to diplomacy. But NK isn't the only nation we have to worry about. China and Russia are NK allies, and they do respond to diplomacy to varying degrees. Obama didn't stop them from getting nukes but they didn't attack anyone. The problem with military action is that they can already destroy tens or hundreds of millions of innocent people before we could neutralize them, and Kim is crazy enough to do that. You're saying it's worth Seoul being wiped off the map, maybe Tokyo too, in order to keep Kim from developing his nuclear arsenal a little bit more. He's had WMDs for a long time and hasn't used them on anyone. A military strike that would ensure he *does* use them isn't the best option IMO. Kim knows that if he strikes first, he'll be wiped out. He's crazy, but does have enough self interest to keep him from doing that. So continuing to work on his nuclear capabilities isn't as bad as so many are trying to make it sound. Yes, he's a madman with nukes. But so is Trump. We need de-escalation, not escalation. If Trump fucks this up (which he does with almost everything he touches, things *way, way* less of a quagmire than NK), it could easily start WWIII. I'm not willing to risk that over a pissing match between Kim and Trump. I dont think Seoul or any city in Japan will be wiped off the map. People are seriously overestimating NK capabilities, and underestimating America's (possibly because everyone likes to trash on the US these days). If you think Trump is an unstable dictator, then I feel sorry for you because it must be hard living with autism.Many comments to this article are very derisive, not to Trump, but to the Japanese response.  The top comment in this thread we are replying to was one such comment.We can't intervene with NK because we know they have nukes, this problem has gone on for so long because it's not worth the amount of lives it would waist to to do anything about NK on top of the fact that every country we have gotten involved in has formed terrorist organizations with explicit hate for America, imagine the ISIS of NK, there should not be a direct reason to get involved even with being provoked, which is why so many presidents in the past have simply ignored the situation, NK can't win by using nukes they would simply be wiped off the map by either us or our allies, so provoking like our current president has been doing is needless,  So should we have done something before they had nukes?The problem was even before the nukes they have always had artillery aimed at Sol, no matter what we did the amount of lives that would be instantly lost before we could even mobilize our forces have never been worth the fall of NKWell, we may see how things shake out if that attitude prevails.  Once the unstable nation tips over, we'll all know about it.NK has saber rattled before. They started testing nuclear detonations back in 2009. The saber rattling started much before even that. At what point do you take their word for it and commit the lives of your nation’s soldiers to the cause? I’d much prefer to see whether they’d try to strike first. There is little doubt that the world community would unite against the usage of such weopens—it’d bring about a swift end to their empire. There's never been as much a rogue state as NK with nuclear weapons before.  I think it's irresponsible not to take action.  And I've thought as much for many years, I'd look up some old comments where I complain about ignoring NK in favor of intervention in the middle east, but I'm too lazy.You think North Korea now is bad? What the fuck you think happens when we conquer the area? We give half to Japan and half to South Korea.  South Korea turns it into a giant PC Bang, Japan turns it into a neon-lit anime amusement park?Seriously though, intervention can have positive outcomes; Japan itself is an example of one.Japan started that war.South Korea would actually be he example you want.Anyway, the problem is the same as it ever was, China. They are the reason North Korea exists at all.To be honest just start worrying if you see different status of rok or us forces in Sotuh Korea. We are not allowed to do anything without their approval.[deleted]As fun and cathartic as that might be, assassinating foreign heads of state is very much against the Geneva convention. Really? I think they already fired a volley over a country that is still an ally. Not that we will have many allies by the time trumputin is done.[deleted]There is no way to not misshandle it, since politics in general aren't black and white.If they did that to the U.S., we would have gone to war, no doubt.He has threatened everyone and eventually once even more out their resources are gone they will be more likely to fightA few years ago they sunk a south korean destroyer. Nothing... as it should have been - the restraint needed to avoid conflicts is daunting, but the alternative is literally nuclear war or at the very least, thousands upon thousands of innocent lives being lost.Exactly. And this might be the first time someone's given a conservative estimate on reddit... if a war broke out without time for evacuation the death toll in the Koreas would reach a million fairly quickly Thousands?  There is no way this would end with less than *millions* of lives lost.Which is why we're not going to preemptively attack NK. There is no military option that isn't catastrophic. What Trump is rather clumsily doing is forcing China's hand. He knows China doesn't want the US flexing its muscles in their own backyard. Even if the US settled for a strategy of containment it would involve stationing missile defense systems, warships and maybe even nukes in the region. China wants none of it. However, they COULD pick up the phone to Kim right now and say "listen, pal, we'll fly you to China and set you up in a nice little place....and we strongly suggest you take us up on the offer". Install a puppet government, everybody wins.At the altitude they crossed they were way, way above even the most generous interpretation of sovereign airspace. The United States certainly doesn't consult with other nations when they launch at those heights.Not that this makes NK nice or good neighbors or anything and they certainly have history with Japan that might make them concerning to say the least. The whole "shot missiles over Japan thing" is overblown though and kinda unneeded. The PDRK is bad enough without needing to exaggerate.It depends whos shooting what where.We disnt see anyone bitching about our iver 2k nuke tests in the 50s-60sThe ones that did bitch we threathened to nuke (ussr) into oblivion.Embargoed cuba for decades for excercising a parallel to what goes on now.We also publically announced what we were doing and did not launch them over other people's territory.Yea...that wasnt a publcity stunt by mcdonalds.It was a threat the timeJapan, Seoul and 37,000 US Troops hope to God you're right...Pack it up guys. If WhisperingPenis from the internet says there is no threat, then there is no threat. Okay, you can't just keep saying that. They want to provoke. If they get desperate enough they will.Which is exactly what slapping sanctions on them is going to make them, desperate.Seriously?  Why wouldn't they?  The shitgibbon in the Oval Office keeps threatening him.  It's almost rational for them to believe that the US might invade them.Dude, every post you make is about POTUS. Why do you let him live rent-free in your head? It's obsessive."Why do you let him live rent-free in your head"This is so good that I'm going to steal it.Because everything the DPRK does is designed to scare others from invading them, and to keep those in power in power.Their ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons aren't going to destroy the US... hell, there's a high possibility they would never even hit the US... It's that if you invade them, there's the threat that they can wipe Los Angeles/Seoul/Tokyo off the map in a last act of defiance.Striking those cities first does what? It guarantees war, and the end of the regime. It's essentially suicide by US. They're not stupid.It's threats they know will enter the US media to make us adverse to the idea of striking first, and ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons to scare us and our leaders that cities can be removed from the map in a last act of defiance.The only thing new is that Trump's too fucking stupid to see it, and falls hook line and sinker for DPRK's shit, like the fool he is.Yes NK have only been assholes since Trump came to office... on the other hand, it's far more likely you've only been old enough to read the news since Trump came to office. U.S. did invade NK, 60 years ago. North Korea has been a dangerous tyranny for multiple presidents.The difference is that *this* president is antagonizing and threatening NK instead of being any kind of a diplomat.Obama, Bush and Clinton let NK know that we had no interest in invading them.  trump makes it sound and look like an invasion is imminent.  they are showboating.  If you want the advantage of first strike, you don't advertise it.nice try Japan. you just want a standing army again.Sweet.Guess we'll be invading Iran, then!You're welcome, world. /sPeople have been saying this for the last 10 years and I'm still here.  A perfect example of how the media encourages fear mongering and ridiculous head lines just to grab views.Edit: lol lot's of nut's messaging me now telling me the end of the world is Nigh."I found a snowball, so global warming isn't real."Quite different this time. Tensions are really high this go around. Media isn't making this better but the blame is on NK for the tensions. Direct threats to nuke a reachable target for them and a new leader who has ramped up rocket technology in the past 5 years in which has made more progress since, than in the last 50 years.The means are now there. The will has been expressed for a generation. NK scientists are now no longer showing up in public events. Everyone is digging in. Cold War II is starting.You would still likely be here even during a full out Nuclear war. One thing is for sure is how the media does over blow that. That type of war won't last long and fall out is always over estimated. NK is more likely to cause mass amounts of damage with chemical weapons.&gt; the blame is on NK for the tensions.The blame is largely on Trump for being stupid enough to respond to regular bullshit from DPRK.DPRK hasn't said anything new. Threaten to strike the US so the media plays it an the US population gets weary of war. It's the same tale over the past 20 damn years.The difference is Trump refuses to just go "stupid Norks" and let it go, he has to be the bigger stronger scarier man, and makes his own moronic threats.DPRK isn't going to nuke anyone. They're not fucking morons. The second a nuke is in the air, the timer starts until that whole regime is dead. Their nukes are so if the US strikes first, they can wipe out whole cities in a last act of defiance, in order to deter invasions in the first place. Literally everything that regime does, is designed to ensure that regime stays alive. It's quite simple honestly...The blame rests of Trump, just as it rests on the kid in middle school who doesn't just ignore the dumbass making a "your mother" joke.It's not "your mother" joke when it involves shooting missiles over nations to scare them. Just as you said , words are words and you excuse NK, but not Trump.North Korea has always been a mess...but our leaders have handled it without a major issue. This time, Trump is turning up the heat on a lot no one wants to see boil. Obama even conceded that North Korea was the major number one threat to America and the region we he left (in a letter left to Trump).The bulk of the last missile technology upgrades came under Obama. Not blaming Obama but even he couldn't ignore it. Colin, do you know anything about what you're talking about or are you just a ten year old with internet access and time to kill? There are so many differences this time it's hard to know where to start. * NK has nuclear missiles and the ability to do significant damage * The US President has been SO unbelievably bad at diplomacy with NK that a rational argument could be made for believing that a US invasion of NK is imminent.They already had the ability to do significant damage before. The difference is...Trump is the leader now and he's an idiot. Have you ever worked for a factory and a new boss that's an idiot starts? All of a sudden all those little issues that were small problems under the last boss turn into huge issues that can't be solved anymore. And the desperate solutions usually make the problems worse. Bad leaders turn minor problems into huge problems that can put the entire company into danger. At some something has to be donePreferably by China/Japanit's too touchy with the US at the moment China won't, Japan can't.Neo-cons/Neo-libs are propping up the war machine yet again. Watch out.https://m.youtube.ctom/watch?v=hjlBMl6f3hUhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w-0TEJMJOhkRequired listeningDont we have missile defence systems?we are at least half a century ahead of North Korea technologically, any nukes they do have, which may be a handful, could easily be intercepted by our defences.Intercepting missiles isn't as simple as it sounds. I thought the same thing. You should look into it, its pretty interesting actually.Missile defense systems really suck in general. Getting them early before they get going is easiest, but its difficult to get in range of the launchers. Getting them in transit could be done, but you need to properly predict its path and get launchers in that area.Getting them when they come down is like shooting a bullet out of the sky. You not only need to shoot a lot to have a good chance at hitting, but you need enough in the area you want to defend. All this and the interceptors don't have the best record in ideal test conditions. In fact, its a big deal when it does work in testing.A perfect defense system is the holy grail in the nuclear arms race because you can attack freely with no threat of retaliation. We do have missile defense systems, but they are nowhere near as effective as trump and others would have us believe, even against older missiles.They're actually stupid effective against older systems and even newer short range systems. Their fault lies heavily with long range systems, new and old.THAAD and Aegis BMD (when using the SM-3 at least) are virtually 100% in tests, including shooting down actual short and medium ranged ballistic missiles.You forgot GMD securing CONUS.I didn't forget it. GMD is far from effective, and I don't consider it a reliable system as it stands, where as THAAD and AEGIS BMD (again, with the proper SM-3s) are incredibly effective against most threats, with the exception being ICBMs, which GMD isn't great at either.With up to 4 interceptors fired at one target with using the test interception chance of 55% by tests that are up to 18 years old, it seems like a quite good chance and would match with the things the responsible persons say.&gt; could easily be intercepted by our defencesNot really. They've never had a real test where they didn't know when a missile was coming and also didn't know the origin and target.Also we can only launch a few interceptors at a time.  The system can be easily overwhelmed.Knowing where it's headed and where it's coming from is the easiest part, especially when having a THAAD radar pointed at the origin. Hitting a relative small object at a lot of Km/s is the hard part.Mid-course corrections, MIRVs, decoy warheads, there's a lot of stuff going on here.  Its not quite that simple.THAAD missles target threats in *reeentry*, not *boost* phase.  The radar used in THAAD is a AN/TPY-2, from Raytheon.  This system can detect missiles in the boost phase, but has to be forward-deployed.Then you should deal with itFirst they will have to change article 9 of their constitution which outlaws war or the threat or use of force to settle international disputes.Then they should do that They can't and shouldn't They could. That was originally created to prevent the possibility of a repeat of Japan circa the 1900s through 1940s, I'm honestly not worried that Japan is going to try to conquer the entire Pacific again if they reinstated their military. Autonomous drones ...wave after wave because lets face it gundams are innefficient.Sure they might not bit i wouldnt count on anti-gaijin sentiment growing and old feuds re started.Japanese hate korean, chinese, taiwanese....Theyre like us but over thereThey aren’t a sovereign country? They are, sort of. After WWII they were forced to give up their standing army and become pacifists in exchange for our protection. Wanted to avoid the whole thing happening again. You mean 70 years ago? They better change their laws cause China is gonna come knocking soon. Your point isn't lost. We don't want to be bound to protect them if it means war with ChinaThey were forced?You should maybe go read some more dude. Yeah it was part of the terms of surrender. Of course they sort of whitewash it as they elected to be pacifists. Do you know nothing of the outcome of world war 2?I know it was was over in 1945 and it’s currently 2017. That would be our responsibility. After world War 2 we basically forced them to become pacifists and said we'll protect them instead. 70 years ago? They need to change their laws if they want a chance to protect themselves from China in the near future. You *definitely voted for TrumpWhy? Cause I don’t understand why Japan isn’t interested in protecting themselves?Japan actually has one of the strongest militaries in the world, easily in the top 10, they just don’t have authority to act offensively, they must strictly be defensive.Seems to be open for interpretation It’s really not. The US has a treaty with Japan that is still in effect. The US is to deal with all external aggressions while the Japan forces are to deal with internal threats and natural disasters. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Mutual_Cooperation_and_Security_between_the_United_States_and_JapanI’m sure we wouldn’t mind some help in countering China militarily while we help them economically till they can finally destroy usMaybe with all the radiation they've been dealing with after 11/3/11 or 3/11/11 and Fukashima they're not all that worried about fallout drifting down from NK?I hope this entire shitstain human race gets wiped out.
Valiant ISIS warriors proving their courage against defenseless victims. Allah must be so proud. Such a pathetic and impotent bunch of cunts, guess they will be used as the 72 virgins.I know how clingy 1 virgin can be...dealing with 72 will be hell! Enjoy, cowards! &gt; Enjoy, cowards!As you sit safely behind your screen. its incredible that people in 2017 are still ignorant about the 72 virgins myth. But why try and learn Islam from its main source when you can learn it from the gatestone institute or alex jones. Repressive views on women &amp; LGBT individuals, shitty dietary rules, boring dress codes, no spiffs, banned sex outside of marriage and a strong anti-dog viewpoint. Yeah, I'm good when it comes to Islam and no fucking thanks. &gt; the Qur'an says that one of the favors granted to those in Paradise is houris "untouched before them by man or Jinni",[27] which implies that they are (female) virgins.[28] They are described as virgins in 56:36 (although the word in another context can mean "first-born").From the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houri#Description_of_the_houris)Go ahead and cite the Quaran to show me how it "doesn't really mean that" because of interpretation, or some other religious bullshit.Honestly, as much pain and suffering as this belief system and its radicals have caused, I don't want to know anything about it. I wish it (and all religions) would just be forgotten so that we can actually accomplish something as a race instead of killing people over the misinterpreted wishes of Allah, God or whatever other foolishness many people believe in. Even without the radicals, I could never respect a belief system that leads to such oppression of women and LGBT individuals.If everyone was more like you then the world would be a much better place for everyone.Why learn Islam in the first place? That's how they spread their radicalism. Better to led it fade away in memes and halftruths so that it can be reclaimed by more progressive/moderate Muslims. The thing with the 72 virgins or however many was started by the west as propaganda. The following is a quote from the quran(apparently)ukhari Volume 8, Book 73, Number 73: Narrated Thabit bin Ad-Dahhak: ”And if somebody commits suicide with anything in this world, he will be tortured with that very thing on the Day of Resurrection." Oh man what was I thinking jumping into this discussion before my first cup of coffee lolSo smothered by bosoms then...&gt;Why learn Islam in the first place?So that you can actually make an informed opinion about Islam whatever that opinion may be.As soon as they mentioned an invisible wizard who lived in the sky I had all the information I needed to make an informed decision.How are you supposed to understand things like islamic terrorism, if you don't know learn anything about the religion. We understand all that's needed to know already. Terrorism with religion as its front is still terrorism, still wrong and needs to be obliterated. I can't believe you're getting downvoted for this. There is nothing wrong with more learning. If you're opposed to Islam, then all the more reason to understand it.&gt;*But why try and learn Islam from its main source...*You mean ISIS?Good point, but there is no trace of critical thinking in this thread. If there were we'd see a few comments reflecting on:"I wonder if the war we started has anything to do with this tragic unrest?" "Did the half million war dead radicalize anyone?""When we bombed every major Sunni city in Iraq to dust, how many innocent civilians did we kill?"Allah would be. This is exactly what Mohammed did. You act like Allah doesn't encourage that behavior in both the Bible and the Quran.  Allah is probably *very* pleased at the slaughter.  This is a "god" who accepts innocent human sacrifice as a valid means of forgiving sins.  If you were under the impression the god of Abraham was a loving pacifist you've misread their scriptures.You act like Allah exists and can encourage behavior instead of shitty human beings writing those books and encouraging that behavior. They're just highlighting that anyone who hates Muslims for their scripture and doesn't Christians or (moreso) Jews is probably a hypocrite.See the thing is, Christians and Jews tend to interpret the Torah/Old Testament within historical context, like a sane person does. ISIS thinks the Quran is as directly applicable today as when it was written, and act accordingly. The people hating Muslims aren't hating them for their scripture, but rather their actions.But this is exactly what Muhammad did, over and over and over, proudly, in the name of Allah. The same Muhammad that hundreds of millions of Muslims follow and name their children after. Victim blaming much? You know that over 90% of the victims of ISIS are Muslims right? I take your comment as a celebration of this attack because you did not waste a moment to vilify the religion of the victims.  The sarcasm was implied by the outrageousness of the statement.Knee-jerking much? My comment vilifies ISIS, not Muslims. Read it again, then think for a full minute before typing. Also take that stick out of your ass. Yet, you imply that ISIS makes Allah proud. Sarcasm or not, I doubt the people who upvoted you thought that you were taking a stab at ISIS and not Islam... the religion of the victimsI took it as a joke on ISIS not Islam. If you're blaming me for other people not understanding sarcasm, well alrighty then. You go have yourself a nice day! *religion of the attackersVictims were considered infidels by ISIS. But keep getting outraged over things you don't understand. Should I get angry since you're trivializing Islam into a single religion? Nah I'm just glad no one cares. Live and let live.Remember when these type of people were being called "freedom fighters" and we were told we were racist if we said otherwise? Good times.What? Who? When?You mean back when you imagined that and then pretended that what you imagined is real?If you’re referring to the CIA-trained Afghani mujahideen during  Reagan’s administration, you might have a point (because I *do* remember “those type of people”). But as vague as your comment is, it seems like an indictment against *anyone* you’d choose to call “these type of people”.Reagan did indeed refer to such mujahideen as “Freedom Fighters”, in the US’ attempts to forestall the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (and it worked too. The Afghani conflict played a considerable role in the crumbling of the USSR).But your phrase “These type of people” is a phrase commonly interpreted as prejudice and bigotry.I wouldn't say considerable. certainly a roll, but a small one in the over all umbrella. Really, it was trying the play tit fro tat with how much military that had compared to the US.Had the stopped when they had enough to destroy the world a few time, they might still be around.Meh, historians differ on the impacts. Not only the economic ones, but the political ones caused by party schisms and the inspiration it provided breakaway republics.It’s hard to drop a single weight onto the scale of such a complex, enduring geopolitical conflict and proclaim it as “more or less considerable” than others, true.[It was a hell of a thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soviet–Afghan_War), that’s for sure. It changed much of the world and profoundly set the stage for our times.For some reason, this won’t link. The “Aftermath” section is quite compelling.https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soviet–Afghan_WarThese type of people, meaning terrorists. Is it prejudice or bigotry to call them that?When Bush sent troops in, anti-war protesters would often call the Taliban "freedom fighters" against the American Invaders. That is fair enough of them. But similarly now when you don't call someone by their preferred pronoun, you are a bigot and homophobe. At the time if you did not think of them as "freedom fighters" you were obviously a racist, or as you would be called now, an Islamophobe.Easy now, we’re simply discussing language.I’d think that, were I to interpret the truth of your statements, I’d phrase them as “One man’s terrorist is another man’s Freedom Fighter.”That’s a dark irony of history, there. I’d not disagree with that at all.Nah man, definitely not what anyone was doing. What pronouns are you using that get you called homophobic or a bigot? If it's that big of an issue for you I'm kind of getting the vibe you might be closer to those things then you'd like to admitI do not remember that because it didn't happenYeah, it's almost like some people got called out for overgeneralizing that groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS represented all Muslims, as if Westboro Baptist represented all Christians. I thought ISIS was done.They are on their way out, but can still do damage to innocents.Maybe in Iraq and Syria,Sure, that's what our propaganda says, but why is it that every time I turn in the news these fucking animals have a new stronghold somewhere or some new tragedy?What do you mean propaganda? Its fact that they have lost a ton of territory, revenue and support.I just mean it always sounds like we're on the cusp of defeating them once and for all. All the time. I guess I'm just feeling fatigued about it.That's cuz they are desperate and fighting a losing battle. They've been steadily losing territory the past year and a half. They're not going be defeated overnight.Oh poor you so "fatigued".And who exactly is "we"? It's not you. It's not even your country's army. Though credit where credit due, the US army is one of the outside forces assisting in the fight. The ones who are actually taking the full brute force of it are the Iraqi army and Kurdish Peshmerga forces. So if you are "fatigued", then how the fuck should those two groups feel?PS: ISIS cells aren't going away anytime soon. So I hope that's not too fatiguing for you. The "state" of the Islamic **State** of Iraq and Syria has been pretty much destroyed by the local forces fighting on the ground, but broken terrorist cells of that terrible group will continue to persist for a while.Welcome to the real world buddy.It is warfare it happens, even the Nazis in there final days had bits of fight left in them, in the winter of 1944 the allies where winning the war and it seemed like theyd be in berlin by Christmas, but the Nazis had a surprise attack and thus we had the battle of the bulge. ISIS is dying, it just doesn't happen in one battle.That's the fault of sensationalist media constantly saying "This is it!" for clicks.Everyone involved knows that this will be a shitty slog, and it still won't be over even after they lose all of their territory. They'll just switch over to solely committing terrorist attacks like Al Qaeda.It’s an organization that has an international presence, it’s going to take a whileThey also spread to the Philippines.They're just moving the battlefield if you ask meThey didn't spread to the Philippines: people already there pledged allegiance for the fame/money. All that did was create a Casus Belli against themselves that practically spans the world. Not from their main supporter - Israel.Just the other day Israeli weapons were found in an ISIS hideout in Syria.First off, I'm gonna need a source on that. That's a wild accusation.Also, just because Israeli weapons were found in an ISIS hideout, doesn't mean that Israel sold or gave them to them. You do know that ISIS is known to pillage, right? That constitutes stealing.you have the internet just Google it .If they were stolen then why weren't the losses reported?I did Google it. I found nothing which is why I asked for a source. Also, how do we know they weren't reported? Are you saying that Israel discloses all forms of theft to the media?ok then here are a few different reports of the storyhttp://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/Syrian-army-finds-Israeli-made-weapons-in-IS-hideouts-507668http://sana.sy/en/?p=116150http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2017/10/19/539198/Syria-Israel-Daesh-ISIS-weapons-NATO-Mayadinhttp://www.attworldnews.com/middle-east/syrian-forces-discover-israeli-nato-made-arms-in-isis-hideouts/To steal that many weapons would result in a large fire-fight, which would definitely be reported.First off, you really only need the first two sources, as the last 3 are basically the same information (The last two are copy/pasted).Also, none of these sites say that Israel is funding ISIS. They just say that weapons were stolen.If you look, you can find this article: http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Weapons-stolen-from-IDF-army-base-in-southern-Israel-494169. Basically, it says that weapons were stolen at night with nobody finding out until the next morning. Also "there was no evidence of a break-in at the warehouse". So this means that there were competant theives, or some people on the inside stole weapons. Neither really matter as neither are supported by Israel directly.Also, I do realize that other weapons were found than what was listed in the article I've posted. However, if this happened after that fact, perhaps Israel didn't know that the weapons were missing? There has to be just a huge stockpile of weapons that they don't use that they just keep in storage. Or possibly they just didn't report it because it would make them seem easy to steal from. It hardly matters (I can only speculate). My point is that there's no proof that Israel actually gave these weapons to ISIS, nor proof that they support them.It doesn’t really matter. if/when we defeat Isis another group just as bad will rise in the Middle East to take their place. Just remember the French resistance fought on for years under Nazi occupation.  Just because you're not as organized as you once were doesn't mean you give up your guerilla tactics.  Maybe you should actually follow the topic on a more regular basis, then. ISIS has be steadily losing territory for a couple years now. Yes, they still have the ability to fuck shit up sometimes. No, they're not already defeated.But they're a relic of what they once were. They're on their way out and have been for some time now.If you're interested, check out https://www.liveuamap.com from time to time (the ISIS section). It's certainly far from perfect, but it's an easy way to get a (very) basic understanding of what's happening where, and when. You'll notice that ISIS is losing ground near daily, and that what area they do still control has little overall strategic importance. You're mentality is correct, despite the downvotes (Reddit, amirite?).  ISIS is getting support from various places and its become a bit of a game of Whack-A-Mole with them.  However, with Trump suspending arming of "moderate rebels" and withdrawing other forms of support (such as air support that had a strange tendency to hit "allied" forces in Syria), we are definitely seeing ISIS lose ground in Syria.  Although there are other "mysterious" forces supporting them, the infection that is ISIS seems to be losing the battle.  Only time will tell, however.They're taking innocent lives with them as they go out.  As a state they're done, they've lost their foothold, but they've been an insurgent group for a lot longer and they'll return to that.It's basically impossible to entirely eradicate extremist muslim groups, the very act of removing them from power radicalizes more.As a sovereign territory/city state type deal they've got going right now, but they will probably always exist as an insurgencyGhidorah never dies.You cut off one head and there are 7 fucking more.2 more.  King Ghidorah has *3* heads, in toto.  You are thinking of some other hydra.  ;)ISIS is done when Saudi Arabia and Qatar says they're done...what does that mean?"...we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region." - Hillary Clintonhttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774Are they supplying troops too?

These groups terrorize more Muslims than non-Muslims to begin with.ISIS can stop pretending to be Muslim or any religion at this point.  Why kid anyone about the fact that ISIS is simply an overgrown street gang that doesn't know how to enjoy booze or drugs.Calling them an overgrown street gang would be patently false, that's why. The only thing they have in common with a street gang is that it's run by violent people. Their origins, their motives, their tactics... all pretty damn different. Calling them muslim or not muslim is a job for propagandists with some sort of skin in the game... objectively, ISIS is a violent religious movement. It attracted enough youths with violent hardline islamic viewpoints in the muslim world to create an army. It's now in it's death throws. i'm pretty sure they enjoy both and they really like the raping.

Can we just refer to them as something they dont like?I've read that they don't like the term Daesh.We don't refer to Al Quaeda, the Taliban, Boko Haram and Al Shabab by something they don't like.The West has already invested a lot of money in solidifying the ISIS brand as a recognizable boogeyman.For some reason mainstream media goes on about civilian casualties when it's the US or Russia, yet when ISIS deliberately murder civilians they decide not to report it.The headline of the article is literally "ISIS kills 128 civilians" so I'm not sure how you can say they're not reporting on it. And they report it when the US and Russia do it because you're not supposed to kill civilians, and bringing attention to it holds the responsible parties accountable and helps ensure that fewer civilians are killed in the future.Sure that's happening....You're literally commenting on a post that says isis killed civillians That's not trues. See: The very article.Idiot.
Interesting... yet Manhattan DA declined to charge Weinstein "after analyzing the available evidence" and an envelope of campaign contribution.The fact that I know the name of a Manhattan DA tells me that there's been a problem. I hope he goes down just as hard as everyone that he's helped.When I read comments like this and see that they actually happened it makes me feel like we’re in an episode of Gotham Good, I'm sure this was a systemic problem, and not just one guy at the top.  Yea I’m not buying any of the aides “omg I had no idea!!” Defenses. You’re setting up meetings at hotels  and bars instead of conference rooms. The fuck did you think was going on. Good. These people need to pay for what they've doneHopefully this will expose the rest of these animals. They need to be brought back down from their pedestals, and answer for the culture they promote.There have been several of these articles about the NY AG launching investigations into various questionable activities.  Is it actually amounting to anything or is this just the AG playing the soundbite game? So that he can purposefully botch the investigation and ruin the chances of a conviction?He's the representation of California LiberalsHe was born in New York and The Weinstein Company is headquartered in New York. So, no. OMG shuuuuuuuut UPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP.[removed]Why do you think their religion is at all relevant?[removed]But if I called you a Nazi you'd get offended I bet Sprinkle in something about (((cheese pizza))) and we got ourselves an r/conspiracy post.Sounds like a Hollywood movie. Hollywood actors acting as Hollywood actors defending Hollywood actors from other Hollywood actors that where harmed by another Hollywood actor.Quick, get Jennifer Lawrence on the phone.It's actors all the way down.This disgraceful abuse of power is inexcusable.  Do they have any idea about the good work Weinstein has done?Like Trump the rapist
If the school doesn't stop her from doing this, people should file a Title IX complaint. Schools are prohibited from discriminating against students on the basis of sex.&gt;“I will always call on my Black women students first. Other POC get second tier priority. WW come next. And, if I have to, white men.”She's not even framing this as some kind of thought experiment, she's blatantly stating she intends to discriminate against a demographic based on gender and race. To hell with the obvious discrimination here, fire her for the sheer stupidity of thinking this could *ever* be acceptable. Agreed, that's textbook racism and sexism. This kind of thing is becoming much to prevalent in today's society. Anyone who criticizes them is met with accusations of sexism and racism. Kind of ironic. Yes, and it's all because of Nazi's that she is under fire now. I hope she never works in academics again. Everyone to the right of Mao is a Nazi, you'd know that if you took her class.How so? Seems more like a reasonable person thing.Title VI also prohibits discrimination of the basis of race. She's 0 for 2.Colleges are dominated by people with her mindset, or scared enough to not act against it out of fear of being demonized. You really think the kangaroo courts in college are going to do anything about this?That's why you file a Title IX complaint with the government. Take it out of university courts and into the US courts.&gt; Colleges are dominated by people with her mindset,No they aren't, that is propaganda the news wants you to focus on instead of actual political matters. Yes, people like that exist, and there are probably a few everywhere, but it is not 'dominated' by it. Thats fox news spin.It's sort of Fox News spin, but at the same time I do think there are certain departments at universities that tend to be dominated by this kind of thinking. The real problem, though, is that these sorts of people hold so much power and influence that university administrations are unable or unwilling to do anything but turn a blind eye to what's going on. It's not so much that this woman has chosen to do something bad that's a problem, it's that the university has chosen not to discipline her, or at least force an end to the practice. This enabling culture is definitely pervasive.Look, if we don't believe everything the Fox News spin tells us then how are we going to keep people from becoming educated and speaking out? Nazi Germany attacked higher education and the totally-not-nazi Republicans need to attack it the exact same way!&gt; ~~Colleges~~ **Liberal arts majors** are dominated by people with her mindsetFTFY. You don't see this kind of logic used in STEM fields, for instance.Or finance, or law, or literally any other field that matters.Yea but when I see "colleges" I assume it means the administration aka College Corporate. At least at my school they were excessively concerned with diversity and things like that, it wasn't major specific. Just all undergrads who fell under that admin. umbrella. I would be willing to bet it would be much different at technical or trade schools. My liberal arts school on the other hand.. doesn't matter if you were a physics major, econ whatever the administration was the same. Yes, if you go to a liberal arts school, the admins will be more liberal artsy. If you go to a school that is more STEMy, the admins will be STEMy too. And I bet, don't quote me here, but I bet that if I went to a performing arts school, the admins would be more performing artsy. GTFO, no way.I’m sure it will take that over too. &gt; "Surely the future will prove me right, because I can't do it now!"Excellent logic, maybe you ought to have spent more time in college.The nature of prediction lends itself to uncertainty, but the people claiming liberal arts colleges have jumped the shark haven’t exactly been proven wrong. I don’t see how STEM degrees have a force field to protect them from the same forces/administration/ideas that have already gutted most liberal arts degrees. &gt; I don’t see how STEM degrees have a force field to protect them from the same forces/administration/ideas that have already gutted most liberal arts degrees.Ask around then. Talk to STEM majors and ask them if *their* professors are like this. They're not. *Their* professors are engineers. Not liberal arts majors making a career out of school. Every "crazy professor" highlighted by the media is a liberal arts major, without really any deviation from that rule.Those people aren’t immune from requirements placed upon them by superiors to keep their jobs. They have bills to pay and kids to feed. I get the sense that you're just repeating what you're told, and you aren't actually *in college yourself*. Okay. Masters in poly sci, never had professor like that.  Edit - she is just a TA.  Luckly, I only had a TA onceYou'll have to wait on his response from Faux News which will no doubt be airing it's nightly coverage of "Wacky college things that this one college did but somehow applies to every college in the country."I get the sense that you have never had responsibilities or kids to feed and are only going by what you think people would do when asked to do something or leave and figure out a different way to pay the mortgage. &gt; Colleges are dominated by people with her mindsetI've attended three universities over 12 years and I've never been exposed to this.Here's where you went wrong: You didn't drop out of the 4th grade, go on welfare then bitch on the internet about liberal college elites lording their jobs and their knowing things over you from the comfort of your trailer park.That hasn't been my experience.No, they're not. If your statement were true, we'd be hearing 20 reports of this happening literally every day. And we don't. It's almost like the respective "threats" posed by both the alt-right and regressive left are vastly overstated. Like someone's trying to start a culture war in the US and benefit from it?They will as soon as the endowments they lose out weight her potential lawsuit and payout by the school. That's what happened with Harvard and Chelsa Manning. Backlash and loss of millions in endowments. ^ this is not trueHasn't been my experience. Then again, I'm not into outrage politics and propaganda like you are.They really aren't. The kooks generally get highly visible positions that allow them to make pronouncements and declarations. There's a huge amount of eye-rolling, but outside of a few obvious departments, they don't have an impact on the material itself.Bottom line: You sit in class and get taught non-partisan material because politics is irrelevant to what you're learning. However, you get emails and get to look at posters calling white men rapist oppressors, at which point you roll your eyes and shrug.You are full of shit, this is rare.  &gt; Stephanie McKellop, a Ph.D. student and teaching assistant for a history class titled “Sinners, Sex and Slaves: Race and Sex in Early America,” posted Oct. 16 on her personal Twitter account that “I will always call on my Black women students first. Other POC get second tier priority. WW come next. And, if I have to, white men.”How exactly will discriminating against people bring an end to discrimination? Fire her ass.&gt;assistant for a history class titled “Sinners, Sex and Slaves: Race and Sex in Early America,” posted Oct. 16 on her personal Twitter accountWe should really limit the kind of classes taxpayer funded grants/loans can go to. This side of academia just seems like a cesspool. Nothing wrong with the subject she us teaching. It's HOW she's teaching it that is the problem. Because nothing says we've moved past discrimination like turning right back around and discriminating against people.Idk, I try not to judge, but that seems like a stupid ass class.There's no such thing as reverse racism /sThat’s true tho, it’s just called racism.&gt;A Reddit post that called McKellop “racist” and called for her dismissal drew hundreds of responses. So I guess we've discussed this already?We've been discussing this for years, just swap the names around a bit.Denying someone the same quality of education because of race or gender sure seems like bigotry...Not being called on first is not exactly denying anything thoDunno, I’d get a lot less out of a class if I was unable to engage with the instructor and receive feedbackShe said she'd only call on them if she had to which says far more than just encouraging others to participate. She's bragging about intentionally disadvantaging some of her students solely because of their race and gender.I'm involved in University Administration, and I'd like to share a little bit of context on this comment. Title ix and title iv of the civil rights act both prohibit discrimination of students or the establishment of any situation which might make it more difficult for them to equally experience the benefits of education. For Title ix issues, that often takes the form of athletic participation, but it also applies to a wide variety of situations which may make it difficult to attend classes or have equal classroom opportunities. The PHD student in the original post has very clearly created a situation which violates both Title vi and Title ix. There is no circumstance under which what she is doing could possibly be construed as anything other than textbooks discrimination. More to the point, what she is doing also demonstrates that her department has done a very very poor job of preparing her to actually be an academic. Graduate students who wish to pursue careers in academia must take courses on pedagogy, and teaching, and the responsibilities of the educator to fully educate all students. What we are seeing here is that her advisor, and her department chair, and her University writ large do not have a good preparation system in place that actually teaches students how to handle themselves as educators. If I were a graduate of this department, or of this University at all, I would be incensed, because her actions are cheapening my own degree and my own ability to get a job. What university would ever hire me if I were to say that I took the same classes as this crazy lady?The whole thing is a little sad, since, with a course title like that any white men in the class likely chose to be there because they care about those sorts of topics.  So to exclude them just further promotes the "us versus them" mentality that really should be eroded if anyone wants real progress.I see a lot of university profs trying to be edge lords and stir the pot on social media by being "reverse racist" but they never seem to get disciplined. Why is that? Because nobody wants to admit that "reverse racism" is just plain racism.Marxists dominating university curricula for decades. https://youtu.be/Obr1XqUPEIIHad a teacher in one of those non-useful classes tell us the highest men could get was a B cause of oppression. Got a B. Think all the women got As. My college was like 75% female with both deans being women and most department heads being female. What oppression was going on and needed to be counteracted I have no ideaI would have loved that, because you should be sitting on a fat settlement check if you actually challenged that.I doubt it, hard to challenge the people who will give you that piece of paper when you are 3-4 years and 150k into something. man, if you got kicked out of school for challenging a blatant Title IX violation, you would be sitting on a fatter check.Theoretically, but again the government and Title IX aren’t going to help a white male who complains about a non-core class. They don’t even really want white males in college anyway. &gt; Theoretically, but again the government and Title IX aren’t going to help a white male who complains about a non-core class. They don’t even really want white males in college anyway.Wow, you really are invested in some obviously untrue ideas. Not really. The male demographic in college is shrinking pretty significantly, it isn’t by accident. &gt; it isn’t by accident.No, but the higher ed world has been in a panic to get those numbers up. The idea that they're chasing men off campus is a conspiracy theory with no evidence to support it.Well their concerns and their actions don’t seem related. They have made it pretty clear that outside of a few engineering and math classes education is by women for women. Even fatter check then.Had a female biology college professor tell everyone the fist day of class "she hated men and you'll be lucky if you pass my class."  I wasn't sure if she was joking or what, but males passed as did I but with a dismal C.Yeah, a college was totally letting a female professor fail nearly every male biology student.  That wouldn't at all affect their graduation rates and they'd definitely be allowed to do that.  And nobody would ever file an appeal or a lawsuit and if they did the school would just back it up.I completely believe that happened, just as I'm completely sure you put down all the correct answers and exams and homework but were given a C anyway.Hey looks like you are a victim shamer! Weinstein Co could use some more people of your midset! Your disgusting victim blaming and shaming people for not speaking up when they are faced with discrimination in a situation where there is in an inequality of power is vile and has no place in modern society. We have a case right here of a person in a position of power openly admitting to discrimination of those she felt are less deserving of equality based on personal reasons, and it wasn't the victims of the discrimination, those without power, who spoke up; it was her own brazen bigotry that got her noticed outside of academia. You know who else thinks that it is ok to victim blame? The sexual assault enablers at Weinstein Co. You would fit right inI don't really think this is victim shaming. More like calling someone on their BS. Not everyone tells the truth on the internet especially if it will help them prove a point. Don't care if you do or not.  Like I said I wasn't sure if it was a joke, and when if come down to it obviously males passed her class.If one instructor posed that much of a barrier to a department in their grading they'd be sat down and reminded about who their audience is.  No professor would be allowed to hobble the graduation rates and the GPA of the program because you'd start losing would-be grad students that wouldn't want arbitrary F's on their transcripts.If you fail half your class, that doesn't reflect poorly on the class, it reflects poorly on you.I also don't even believe anyone said that to you in the first place, but I know for a fact they didn't act on it in a biology class.  It's not like the work's quality is subjective where that's even possible.What school was this?  What was the professor's name?  No harm in telling us it doesn't identify you.Of course this happens.  Sexism and racism it tolerated at universities.  This article is proof, and this other guy was just saying it happened to him too.This is hardly the first or last time a college professor has been discovered to be racist.  This one wasn’t even pretending to hide it.  The university must foster an environment where this is okay, if a professor is comfortable being so blatant about it.You think any biology professor in America has ever failed all the male students, apparently year after year as a matter of class policy?Oh by all means, find me just one example of this all-so-often occurrence that's never happened.How is this article in any way proof of that happening?  And how is one guy making up a bullshit story, and mysteriously disappearing when asked to name the school and professor who did this "proof?"I doubt she ever failed everyone in the class, but it’s telling that she feels comfortable enough to publicly express such hatred without fear of punishment.You seem to be conflating the professor in this article for the supposed man-hating biology teacher that fails nearly all her male students and using them interchangeably as though they're one and the same person.No, I’m not.  But they are two instances of many in which universities tolerate discrimination, sexism and racism.  It’s a problem.But that supposed biology professor doesn't exist.  The liar who made up that lie will never return to name the professor or the school, and you'll never find any such article where that's happened.  That's like assuring me that you can call "Trixie" for a good time, because you saw it written on a bathroom stall.Jesus, take a xanaxDid anyone challenge her on that? I think would've raised my hand and told her off right then and there. But then again I'm 40 years old and give less fucks then I used to. If I was 19-20 I probably would've sat there in disbelief.I heard it discussed on campus, but no one challenged or called her out on it that I know of.  She was still teaching 3 years later and I never heard about it being said again in a class.  Everyone, or just white men because of how they were born?pretty sure this is against the law and is opening the school up to a lot of litigation.Now if in the course description, she said she would use activities etc to highlight the disparity held long ago, that might be somehow defensible, but to blanket decide thats how you will run a class, thats pretty easily categorized as discrimination.The problem is that she said it instead of just act on it as is the norm for 800 yearsI think the white people attending a class like this dont need a lecture on racism, based on my own experiences in classes like this.  They are the type of people that will call you racist before the offended minority even feels a sting of discrimination.  Her "example" she's making will have literally zero effect because of the type of people that are joining her class.  Its sad that given the power to choose to discriminate, she chose to discriminate.  She made an example of her class instead of making an example of herself.  What a failureAs a white male I'd have raised my hand to tell her my Black wife and kids told me to tell her to "fuck off". Oh and I'd sit there with my hand permanently raised. Every class.lol, I am in the same boat. I am white and have a black girlfriend. Just think, these are the institutions educating an entire generation of teachers who will then go on to repeat the process of discriminatory behavior, only this time, it will be in K-12 and not just in universities.Education should be unbiased and equal. Not what this is.Instructor does racist thing and people want her fired.Follow the money.If her actions cut down on donations or if revenue goes down because fewer students enroll, she'll be gone.It’s sad that colleges don’t care about racism, only money.  But I’m sure nobody will be sad if this place ends up like the university of Missouri.When in doubt, always follow the money.Don't do that!  Clinton Inc. will have you whacked. So we're going for racial and gender equality, which she claims to be fighting for. So let's always call on black women before other races and sexes. Yeah, very equal.Sure, she's a shitbag, but I'm rolling my eyes at the outrage. She's a grad student teaching a throwaway elective class in Resentment Studies. Who cares?I'd care a hell of a lot more if it were a professor teaching English 101 and pulling this shit, as students outside the major have to take it and don't have a choice. You *definitely* have a choice on whether you're going to major in Resentment Studies, and you *definitely* have a choice on whether you're going to take this person's class.Shrug, give her a garbage rating on RateMyProfessor, and move on. Making a big deal out of this is retarded.What if your ancestors were thrown into concentration camps by the US government during WWII?  Or if your ancestors were lynched in California during the Gold Rush?She seems to think you can fix racism and discrimination by being racist and discriminating people.Good one.Self-fulfilling institutionalized racism.. Progressive Stacking.. They actually practice what they think they are fighting..Man, every time I think I learn how I'm supposed to act, society changes the rules again. So is it "discriminating is bad, don't do it. Well, except when you think it's okay to do."?  [deleted]except its against the law, and against the policy of the school.  you cant "make an example" of white students to prove a point, its still descrimination and its horrible.  imagine how much money the students paid to get to that class.Grading should not include participation if this is how the course will be conducted. Maybe she wants to give other people a chance to make their voices heard instead of always listening the white kids. She should never have said that to the world though. She could have said that she makes a conscious effort to call on a kids from a diverse range of races, genders, and sexualities, and that she is taking action to make sure she doesn't always call on people from the same group.Instead she just basically said "I never call on white people". That's not promoting diversity, it's just promoting hate.Yes, much more academic. Am I the only one who went to college and all I did was read text books, take tests, and write papers.  You didn't take Sex History and the History of Sex, Slaves, BDSM and Naughty Women who Liked to Tied up and Spanked 101? If this was meant to be a designed social experiment, clearly outlined in her course, then I can see the merit to this.Encourage(could force interaction by stating the course wouldn't start until a black female student starts) 'black women' to be interactive.  Provide 'discriminatory' experience for students who have little exposure.  Create an engaging platform that's not your typical/sterile classroom environment.So sad...Can't students just avoid her class rather than freak out?  The school will get the message.  All the people that want her fired probably say things like "oppression doesn't happen anymore" and "I don't see color"Well obviously it still happens, she is doing it. she is literally oppressing people by race...but you think thats okay?  do you know how much it costs to attend classes like this?  You probably dont think its possible to be racist against white peopleI don't think what's she's doing is okay, but I'd also bet that over 2/3rds of the redditors crying foul over her policy also don't believe black men when they say that cops stop them more often when driving.its not okay to behave the way she did but if I believe she should be fired i must be a racist white dude?  What?  You dont think she should be fired for literal racism?  What if a white professor only called on white people first?  He would get fired so fucking fast and no one would bat an eyelash.&gt; but if I believe she should be fired i must be a racist white dude?Strawman harder.&gt; What? You dont think she should be fired for literal racism?Please. Strawman fucking harder. I don't feel quite misrepresented enough by your shitty attempt at an argument.&gt;  What if a white professor only called on white people first?Both she and the hypothetical professor should be fired.But the trend on /r/news is to lash out against people of color that commit racist slights (no matter how slight) against white people, and turn a blind eye (if not outright insult and accuse of lying) to the *millions* of people of color that cry foul about deep-set and widespread racism across society, which is backed by countless studies as being real and having real effects on real people.strawman argument?  the person i replied to literally said that anyone who is outraged is in fact white, and is in fact racially insensitive.  and i wouldnt call what you said "an argument".  you just stated that you thought people who critized this woman were racially insensitive and white.  you are so twisted it hurts, and your downvoted comments prove itWhy would I think that's ok?Well you do seem to think you know a lot about the ones complaining...this would be the next logical step.Oh fuck I left a word out All of the people defending her are blatant sexists and racists.  Who fucking cares what these pieces of shit think? Seeing people for their individuality is not racist. I don't want someone to see me as a brown person first and then as Engineer_daddy. I'm not a brown person, I'm a fucking individual.  I couldn't have said it better myself. Yet you imply that people that don't see color are racist....Color blinds are the ones holding us back for sure.okay...whats your point? Don't really have one but I wanted to join the conversation People are getting really upset over something so fucking trivial. Focus your time on other issues, please. Don't waste your outrage politics here.I understand that this is a somewhat small problem in the greater scheme of things, but not discriminating on the basis of race is something all Americans are supposed to agree on. There is nothing wrong with expressing some outrage here. [removed]*And, if I have to, white men* She called them based on race, but she called on them regardless. &gt; “I will always call on my Black women students first. Other POC get second tier priority. WW come next. And, if I have to, white men.”Taken straight from the article. She is clearly being discriminatory.I think the only thing that bothers me about this, is that you know this is under the list of "required" electives.  She is definitely making a bold statement, but that is something I would expect from a course with that name.  Why would anyone go to a school where this is a required elective? Because it is an Ivy League school that is also one of the top colleges in the world.That sucks, rich people problems then. I didn’t know the Ivy’s let in white men anymore. Maybe this doesn’t even actually affect anyone. can we just sit back and appreciate we are talking in two different comment threads right nowI’ll check it out. I don’t actually look at names on here like I should. I just picture everyone as a fat dude in the dark in their moms unfinished basement. Well that's a shitty way to prove a point. It just looks like revenge, or sexism/racism. I get what she's trying to do, but this is not a good way to go about it. What she's trying to do?  She's spreading bigotry, plain and simple. I think her point might have been that ignorant white people will take to the streets to defend inequity when it's obviously biased against them but remain silent when there is just as obvious inequity against those not in power. It's really hilarious to see all of these supposedly righteous people talk about equality when it comes to showing a black woman her place, but you show those same people the incarceration or life sentence for not violent crime statistics and they always have a reason why it's not discrimination. Primary bias, plain as a bagel. I keep seeing comments saying this is everywhere but I've yet to experience this. Jumping to conclusions without evidence, must be from T_D.Edit: As you can see they are triggered by the mere fact they are caught in their constant stream of hypocrisy.&gt; Jumping to conclusions without evidence, must be from T_D.Or better yet, you'd have an article with questionable sources about Russian conspiracy theories with the GOP, upvoted into quadruple digits.It doesn't take a Trump supporter to be outraged at racism and sexism towards white males. If the left would agree that whites and males can be victims of bigotry like their non-white non-male counterparts, then you wouldn't be downvoted so much.If you're stupid enough to believe systemic racism against whites exists in the US, you're probably stupid enough to have voted Trump.Wow bravo mentioning T_D......women like her largely made up my college university experience
&gt;Scientists involved in the program said that much of the discussion at the event centers on climate change. Many said they were surprised by the E.P.A.’s last-minute cancellation, particularly since the agency helps to fund the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, Not for much longer I'd bet.I am dispointed but not shocked. Seems very much in line with Trump's refusal to acknowledge climate change (both human and natural and any leadership on how we'll tackle this issue regardless of cause) and very much in step with the interests of big business to maintain the status quo. Head in the sand, I've got billions of dollars in my accounts and that's all that matters. Remember, the EPA symbolizes to many on the New Right the evils of "Big Government" because it has cost corporations and their owners alot of money by enforcing some standards of decency towards our environment. Tl;dr The EPA is on Trump's chopping block. IT's wore then that. Trump knows Climate change is real, and is having construction don't to help protect his golf course in Scotland.This is knowing it'e real and choosing to make the worse decision.That's not ideological ignorance, it's evil.but hey, some rich guys will let him know how awesome he is for making them richer, so hes got that going for him.Trump isn’t an architect. He hired a better man than himself to make those decisions. Trump fully buys into climate truthism. This goes in line with trumps remarks on anyone who slights him he comes after 10 fold. Do you have a source of him saying this?[Start at 22:35](https://youtu.be/jA580xJpPM8)Yuck, so gross. I can't believe this is the man people cast their votes forI still can't believe it either, but it makes some amount of sense. Trump is a political outsider and independently wealthy (though probably not nearly as much as he'd love for us to believe), so his voter base assumed that he could storm the bastille of the modern political establishment. They're angry at a system that they think has abandoned and failed them (which it has in many ways via the erosion of regulations and protective institutions) and wanted to pick something besides our usual "lesser of the two evils" approach. They saw Trump as someone who would actually listen to them and relate to them, not some Ivy League know-it-all who would leave them to rot.The major problem is that they all turned a massively blind eye to everything else about the man (or they actually view his flaws in a positive manner). He has a notorious reputation as a bully, a cheat and a liar. His narcissism precedes him. He openly brags about objectifying and molesting women. He's blatantly racist, or at the very least he makes no effort to behave antithetical to that. And of course he knows fuck all about government and how to run things, so he's making a complete ass of himself as our leader and diplomat to the rest of the world.And despite all that's happened, despite all of the revelations that have been leaking out at unprecedented rates, there are still droves of people who *like* him for all of that. They *like* that he's politically incorrect, they *like* that he's crass and inflammatory, and they *like* that he talks at their level and not in the flowery two-faced language of politicians. He tells them what they want to hear, but his completely unprofessional demeanor somehow makes him more believable than the usual political fare.To be fair there are also plenty of people who now regret voting for him, but they couldn't possibly have not known what Trump was all about from the very beginning. He laid it all out there for people to see, and then some. People either voted for him out of spite or because they genuinely believed in his message.100% agree, and the people who believed his message are the people I have a problem with. We knew from the start that he is a fuckface shady business guy, none of that was hidden, but they still let themselves believe his message despite all the evidence that he would betray them at his first chance if it upped his image. Hopefully this is a wakeup call to that portion of voters.The endless amount of people who said "just give him a chance, who knows" was astonishing and then afterwards the endless defense of people who voted for him... I'm fine with America having it's democratic system, although I don't understand it's endless need to latch onto to the two party system, but a vote for Trump proved you were either a troll or someone so easily manipulated by ad slogans that they could have likely convinced you to vote in a sex doll with a mechanized voice box. I'm glad America is a country with the freedom to elect anyone, but it also gives me the freedom to point who much a moron you must be for wanting that despicable human being as your leader... Me neither. He lost the popular vote by over 2 million, he's a criminal in so many ways and yet he's "leading" the US. Sickening.His entire campaign was built on how Hillary was a "criminal", yet he's one of the shadiest business dealers in the world, who has done far more criminal activities. IDK how people were this dupedBecause woman and "librul".  In exit polls 41% of voters supported building the wall.26% of the voters said they are white Evangelical or born-again Christians. Trump won them 80% to 16%.So building a wall, a tax-dollar paid for, expensive and completely useless monument was more important than electing someone who was, aside from being a criminal, represented the 1% and is a misogynistic pig, also a replica of everything his party claimed to hate.Those people care more about building a wall as a ort of defining feature of this country more than actually caring for the people within that wall. Fashion over function. DisgustingHis business practices are shitty he fucked over people he’s shitty. Hillary is responsible for deaths. She’s shitty. They’re both shitty in equal but different ways. I'm not a Hillary fan either, but at least she wouldn't be up on the podium saying things like "Who knew healthcare would be so hard?" and "Kneeling is disrespectful to our veterans, but prisoners of wars are not war heroes at all".Can you explain exactly how she is responsible for deaths?I voted for him, can't wait to vote for him again in 2020. Yeah, vote for a scheming, money hungry, misogynistic asshole because he represents America, right?He represents America more than any progressive turd does that's for sure.So, you don't care about how he's being perceived by other countries or how he's digging us into a hole... you just vote for him because of spite. Got it. Glad you are being responsible with your voting.And yet he still manages to lose the popular vote.honest question, how? how does he represent America? No he said he voted for trump, why are you bringing up Hillary? It's in his book art of the deal. Gotcha, thanks!.........a book he didn't even write; it was ghost-written and his name just slapped on it.Sounds about on par. His election was set by ghost-comrades as wellYup. His whole life has been about selling his name.Or comes after like a 10 year old, which is also true.Trump?  How about the republicans.  They love this shit; they put pruitt in charge knowing--expecting--this shit to happen.  Let walmart and exxon mobil and shell and halliburton manage things, say the republicans.&gt;because it has cost corporations and their owners alot of money by enforcing some standards of decency towards our environment. More precisely it costs ordinary people much more than the benefits are worth. Let me give you a concrete example. [This fucking bullshit.](https://www.epa.gov/lead/renovation-repair-and-painting-program) This regulation effects me and my customers. It's very expensive to comply with, and the results are so trivial that customers can't actually believe the stupidity of what we have to go through to be in compliance. Bring on the downvotes assholes, I hope Trump fucking destroys the EPA. Yeah, *fuck* the Earth!This set of remediation requirements is to correct the unintended consequences of using lead as a pigment in paint.  Don't blame the government for the amount of work that you have to do to clean up this mess, blame the industry that profited hugely creating the problem, then took the money, ran and left a mess for all of us to clean up.  You hope Trump destroys the EPA, I wish that Congress would grow some balls and force industry to pay you for your hard work.  Removing toxins from our environment is not a bad idea, making all us little guys pay for it is.  We did not create the problem and no, we shouldn't have to pay for the cleanup.this should be criminal, it's negligent and the surest proof of regulatory capture.  time to fucking end money in politics, it's a haven for political criminals.It's not money, it's votes. It's the voters the reelect these deniers that are the problem.Yes, but ultimately these people want to be reelected because it allows them to keep cashing in on corporate campaign donations. Remove those and there's very little reason to go into politics *at all* unless you really want to.You can't get rich on campaign donations.  Also, congress is generally considered to be  underpaid compared to what such people can make in private industry.The reason that congress lusts after campaign donations is because this gets them job security.  Running for office is so expensive that they pretty much have to spend a majority of their time from day 1 in office begging for money to secure their next term.The way to get rich from a congressional position is to reliably accomodate lobbyist's interests and then take on a lobbying job after a few terms in congress.  Those positions can typically yield 7 figure salaries.This is what drives the rot and corruption in congress.This is what we need to fix to save our democracy.  If we don't fix this, America is done for.Unfortunately, it's improbable that the people who were put in power by this flawed electoral system (gerrymandering, unlimited corporate campaign donations) will fix it.It boggles my mind that the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC) was the genesis of the quagmire we're in now.It took lots of money to get enough of those voters to vote against their best interests. Unlimited campaign money is the main problem."...We don't need no oyster reef rehabilitations, we don't need no DDT clean-ups, we don't need no asbestos super-funding, we need jobs making plastic toys with no regulations....not high paid too-intelligent-for-me Scientists, and Aquamologists or whatever you call them goggle divers, and we don't need to clean water 'cause who drinks this stuff anyways when you can get it in a plastic bottle from Nestle' - Ammi right, boss!?..."When the environmental protection agency leadership gets replaced by incompetent fucks who actively want to harm the environment... I don’t think Scott Pruitt is an incompetent person, he was put in there on purpose, and him and the current administration have been wanting to destroy the EPA, and they are getting away with it, this is very frustrating. I hope one day (sooner than later) we can witness some of the consequences and held them accountable, they are literally trying to destroy our population.That moment when you realise the government is filled with Captain Planet villains.They're **not** heroes and they're **not** gonna take pollution down to zero!Trump will just blame Obama somehow, forge a few lies and call anyone calling him out fake news. Business as usual in 2017.I think you forgot the part where he manufactures a loud but unimportant scandal to distract attention. Does that come just after the 'fake news' claim.Sort of like "oh look, a squirrel!"...I'm just glad a few of you are paying attention.  I didn't want to be the only one who is seeing this flashy scandal and immediately starts looking around to see what he wants to take out of the news cycle.  Perhaps another river will catch fire.They'll blame regulation for that, and there fucking idiot constituents will buy it.Their* Speaking of idiots...&gt;  I hope one day (sooner than later) we can witness some of the consequences and held them accountableWe will *all* witness the consequences, but I can promise you that not one person will be held responsible.There's Flint, MI. Although I wonder why that's taking so long, if it's got to do with the EPA......Flint is an example of a local failure of government within the State level.Thanks. Also our future without EPA.....Ugh.Yep.This administration and its supporters would rather watch the world burn to ashes then admit defeat or apologize for their stupidity.  The best we can hope for is them losing the elections so the world can start to repair the damage they’ve done.[removed]&gt; They're risking the future of the species.It's the species that's causing the environmental issues so maybe there's method to their madness. And meanwhile we have morons with the capability to FORCE change, and they’re throwing away their lives attack Jason Aldean concerts in Las Vegas. If anyone is wondering yes I ABSOLUTELY mean what I just said. Imagine that dude taking 29 automatic rifles to meet up with these world-ruining scumbags. That’s making a point, not killing a few people with bad taste in music genres. I’m pretty sure that if that happens then the NRA would not be able to bribe anybody else anymore. But NO, that is not the way to fix it, even though they are creating damage to us, we can not take their lives. We can not lower ourselves to the same level, we do it loud and we do it right, but without violence, violence only muted everybody, the sound of bullets and hate are too loud compared to reasonable ideas. We have to write we have to gather smarter, is the kneeling working? Maybe, but unfortunately people twist it, and they have made it now a white/black issue when it was clearly about abuse of power. We have to protest in a smart way, let’s not make it a issue of us against them. It’s hard, but only the hard things are working/fighting for, at the end the victory will be ours, Democrats/Republicans, religious/agnostics, all races, at the end we all breath the same air. I think we are hitting a death end with the protests, we get to do that, but let’s not just stop there, let’s bring the ideas together, let’s present them.I wish I could upvote this 17 times honestly. Well spoken, it just seems like we’re past the point of that mattering. Our votes mean nothing, writing letters to congress does nothing, petitions mean nothing. We(the dumb generation that is currently 40-70 years old) gave the government complete control over our daily lives. The People voted for AL Gore, a dumb republican became president. The People voted for Hillary Clinton, and an even dumber, way more deserving of death Republican became president. We’re voting for the right people, they’re just laughing in our faces and installing whoever makes the republicans and the Nazis richer. Now we’re talking about the guy in charge of fixing the planet doesn’t believe in climate change, OR DINOSAURS????? Jesus fucking Darwin where do they find these fucktards? The purpose is, beating back what is essentially all rent seeking bullshit. Wanna build something? Oh, need an environmental impact study, gotta pay a bunch of our buddies with worthless degrees! Plus any sort of heavy industry has been pushed out in the boonies, down to Mexico, or sometimes overseas. Want some lead for your bullets? Oh, can't smelt that here! Gotta get the shit from China or Mexico. Tanning chemicals? Need a special license for more than a small amount. Need manufacturing labor? Oh, can't hire high school kids, we kinda killed off all the shop classes because of VOC exposure, things that generate high heat, etc, etc. EPA has been pretty much off the rails after the 80s. They choked out just about all industry in the US. Holy shit you people actually existLead smelting has ruined so many lives. As someone who spent years in the chemical industry - there honestly isn't enough regulation. It's almost entirely up to producers (of non-FDA regulated chemicals) to ensure the long-term exposure safety and hey, guess what, there is factual, admitted evidence (by the producers, in court) of them deliberately burying those risks and harming plant workers, surrounding communities, and possibly the entire population of the US (although proving this last part is almost impossible). Aside from cases of producers burying knowledge, so that they can make money, almost all producers engage in negligence to this regard - they aren't required to ensure that they aren't causing long-term harm to their plant workers or surrounding communities - so they don't. I was also an expat in a country with almost no regulation or enforcement - and guess what, it blows. Shop class in high schools is a totally different topic. You can be in favor of increasing environmental protections and want more trade education, I do, the issues aren't mutually exclusive. But the Trumpers don't want to put forth the effort to adapt to a changing job market and economy, so let's regress as a nation. Things are changing, get used to it, get educated with a skill the economy values. lol! I put some silly pro trotsky comment on one section of reddit, which is an obvious bad joke, and get 100+ upvotes. Do the same thing, semi-serious about the EPA regs strangling out a lot of industry, which is true enough on the small business end more than major industry, and people go into a downvote frenzy. It's only been what, 5-6 years that reddit admins clarified that up and down votes are not agree/disagree buttons. Serious debate simply does not work on a system based on the likes of a jr high popularity contest. You just push away anyone who doesn't agree with you into a group that's just an echo chamber of the same type of opinions over and over.  When that has pushed over into the opinion polls, political factions, and national governance, it was only a matter of time before things got going on the road to hell. People have turned political factions into some sort of religion, and all too many people have started to see government as their foster parents, and that's a recipe for disaster, because no agency in the government is such a sacred cow that you should not be able to suspend it, rip it apart, and restructure it, and restart it(in industry we call these kaizens, plus many other rude terms, but they seem to work if not over used).  Michigan and a few other states have done this, and it BARELY kept things going, in places where they didn't do it, city governments defaulted, and had to be suspended, restructured, and slowly restarted. In agencies like the EPA or DOE, its not going to be pretty. You can't shuffle people between government agencies while restructuring without losing most of them. DHS tried this with some of the various law enforcement agencies it consolidated with some success, but those guys are mostly goons with guns, and investigating crimes tends not to be so super specialized that you can't shuffle people around. NASA, that agency has been under perpetual restructuring since the 70s, but its assumed you're going to get bright eyed newbie engineers all the time, break them in, milk them for their crazy new ideas, crush them under a heartless bureaucracy,  get them used to the ideas of real world engineering compromises, politicking,financial issues, then lose them 5-10 years in for various aerospace and other tech industries. You could call it a finishing school for engineering weenies, but people might get kinda butthurt over that, even if it's 100% reality, because otherwise it's just a money pit. :D Other agencies, people hire in, and they park their asses there FOREVER, they don't get promoted unless they figure out ways to grow their department, and burn up even more money, either government money, or new and improved rakeoffs. You get things like ICE, the same people in charge of hunting down illegal aliens, burying them in paperwork, and then chucking them out 3 years later, who are in charge of enforcing ITAR, which is the BIGGEST tech industry joke of all time. Most of those guys are dumb enough to get stuck in a revolving door. Which is why they get all paranoid about keeping 26-50 year old technology out of the hands of foreigners, even if they're working in other defense industries that are part of NATO, and working on the same joint projects. :D Even if you can just get the information out of the patent database, look at a few trade magazine interviews, and science journals, and have enough information to launch your own derivative in a few years, sometimes less. In theory, it helps keep a lot of defense jobs in the US, in practice, it also forces industry to keep refining obsolete technology, just so they have some wiggle room, and might be able to get some of the older tech made in asia sometime down the line. Unless, you get someone to develop technology in a non-defense industry, wait for other industries to copy it, offshore it, then buy up a company already in asia, and ship the parts back to the US. I wish I was making this shit up, but it's happened, repeatedly, for many many decades. Now as for the EPA, probably you could cut it down 70-80%, and there would still be enough staff to enforce the important regs, and probably offload a lot of work onto state agencies. Lots of things could be streamlined, redundancies, delays, obsolete practices removed, etc. Okay I'm just going to ignore the bulk of your incoherent rant and focus on your 2 points regarding the EPA:1) that EPA regulations prevent growth in some industriesI contend that the current regulations are necessary and expansion may also be required. These regulations are often all that stand in the way of unethical behavior. I also want to know why you would have this growth over ensuring environmental safety - unemployment is close to the lowest it can possibly be in most areas of the US and has been for awhile. 2) that the EPA is bloated and can be reduced in size and accomplish the same goals. Not sure what this is based on, but I am open to this idea IF it is true. Please let me know what evidence you have of this. &gt; Plus any sort of heavy industry has been pushed out in the boonies, down to Mexico, or sometimes overseas. Want some lead for your bullets? Oh, can't smelt that here! Gotta get the shit from China or Mexico. Tanning chemicals? Need a special license for more than a small amount. Need manufacturing labor? Oh, can't hire high school kids, we kinda killed off all the shop classes because of VOC exposure, things that generate high heat, etc, etc.This is NIMBY-ism, and it has very little to do with the EPA.  Turns out, well-to-do people rarely want factories next-door, and will raise hell to keep them out.Because nothing could possibly be more important than the interests of the industry barons, amirite?  Clean water? Nah.  Clean air? No way.  Endangered species? Fuck em!....Why don't you go enjoy a nice cold glass of DDT, eh?The dangers of DDT are vastly over rated and all go back to a complete scientifically debunked book, silent spring.Good morning Alex JonesJesus Christ, are you from the 60's?! There's actually corporate shills still alive saying that silent spring is "debunked"?!What exactly did he say that was wrong? Basically the whole thing. Silent spring has been largely accepted by the scientfic community as it has been proven that DDT is a bioaccumulant in the environment and was causing bird shells to become brittle which was devastating hundreds of different species of bird like the bald eagle, song birds and brown pelican. It was also linked to birth defects in humans, cancer and diabetes. Basically the pesticide companies were the only ones putting on phony commercials saying "Scientists agree that silent spring has been debunked". This is a very much settled issue. Yeah I am saying it is as dangerous as other pesticides not that it is totally benign&gt; It was also linked to birth defects in humans, cancer and diabetes.Please link the papers showing thisSo VOC exposure it’s ok? Killed off any sort of industry? Have you ever been to Texas? Specially the Houston area? Have you ever been in a plant? If you had then you know that all regulations are there for a reason, unfortunately because something had to happen for them to make changes and prevent this again. Have you ever read an EPA regulation? They all have research papers to back up every single regulation. There is a reason why in Pasadena, TX people can breath and live a decent life after the Clean Air Act, before that they used to call it “Stinkadena” for a good reason, very dense smog and bad smell.It's funny, for lots of non-fossil-fuel-burning plants VOCs are all the EPA cares about. Some of these plants, like industrial fermentation ops, pump thousands of lbs of CO2/min and hazardous chemicals into the air but current regulations only require once-yearly testing solely for VOCs. Source: worked in plants for yearsWant to build a fertilizer plant next to a grade school?  BOOM!  (SeeTexas)How about a liquid chemical plant next to a drinking water supply?  Ask West Virginia how that went.If you're so vehemently opposed to the EPA, go stick your mouth on a tailpipe and report back to us on how that goes. Either way, you'll be doing the world a favor. "Wanna build something? Oh, need an environmental impact study, gotta pay a bunch of our buddies with worthless degrees!"Envious much?None of that's correct, and you have been sold a bill of goods.Pay close attention:Labor cost drove manufacturing out. The. End.People who owned these companies stuck a shiv in the us workers back in order to make another buck.I remember when the EPA started. I remember all the poisons, acid rains, undrinkable water, forced to stay indoor due to smog.IN the 90's there were 4 time more cars on the road then in 1970, but only 1/4 of the pollution.EPA is not of the rails. There what business blame while they fuck over the workers.I can only speak for my area, but shops classes are alive and well. &gt; I remember all the... acid rains...No you dont[removed][removed]right you are with pruitt at the wheel of the EPA the war on the environment is back on track and going great!/sI picture this guy going from the tanning bed to the ammo store and back all day, complaining about regulations. Regarding manufacturing, there will be even fewer of those jobs when the smart robots arrive. Has nothing to do with the EPA though. I agree that they need to really promote shop classes. It's not incompetence, it's regulatory capture. The EPA has been compromised. They aren't even hiding it.We don't need the EPA, we can just let individuals sue multibillion-dollar corporations for damages if they pollute, and people won't be customers of polluting companies anyway "because capitalism".HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA..... libertarian bullshit.Incompetent would be a huge step up. Pruitt is just actively evil. &gt; replaced by incompetent fucks who actively want to harm the environment... republicans, they deny as party line.&gt;“They don’t believe in climate change, so I think what they’re trying to do is stifle discussions of the impacts of climate change.”It's not that they don't believe in climate change; it's that they are choosing to ignore it. They don't have the facts and statistics to back themselves up, so they're silencing those that do. If no one can present the evidence, then they can claim there is no evidence.Why the hell are they simply choosing to ignore it? What do they have to gain?pools of money, like olympic sized pools of money.relaxation of regulations means corporations that pay people like pruitt can save literally billions a year. so after pruitt leaves office they give him a "consultant job" or they make him a lobbyist for them and pay him 500k or a million a year. what do they care? they just saved themselves billions a year now that they don't have to handle their waste properly anymore, or take steps to curb carbon emissions from their activities.Actually both sides have gobs of money tied up in this fight. The anti side is backed by heavy industries whose production processes inherently pollute more. The pro side is backed by mainly tech companies, whose manufacturing at their plants produces less emmissions. Now we know the heavy industries would be taxed and regualted so we know how they'd lose money if legislation is passed. Now what does the pro side lose if we don't? Well most proposals are for taxing emmisions and carbon markets, global ones if they can. Well if you have a carbon tax amd markets you can actually make money as a tech company by selling your unused credits to more polluting industries. If you have a global one then you can sell the excess to the foreign companies that make up your supply chain. Making your company "100% green" while in reality all you did was use a loophole to make money and keep the cost of your supply chain low without doing a damn thing. So, lots of money tied up in this whole venture. And you all thought it was about saving the planet.&gt;Well if you have a carbon tax amd markets you can actually make money as a tech company by selling your unused credits to more polluting industriesDepends entirely on how the credit system works. The EU for example is moving towards an auction system, meaning that the tech compagny wouldn't get any credits to give away.Even before that, the more polluting industries always got more credits than tech.In fact, I know of no system under which your plan would work.Edit : You also seem to be confusing Co2 credits with green energy certificates. Those are different things.Nice false balance you got going there.The idea the green energy has anywhere near the money fossil fuels has is laughable, at best.That's only because industry is hindered to be so dependent on fossil fuels. It's laughable how backwards we are forced to beEarth's gonna be fine. It's humans and other macroorganisms who are fucked.Either way though, who says people have to be altruists? This is between the symbiotes and the parasites, and there's nothing wrong with wanting to make bank while maintaining the world.I'd rather tech companies make money by saving the planet than oil companies make money by destroying it. Seems like a simple enough choice to me.The Republican party is bought and paid for by the industries that pollute the most, and stand to lose precious profit margins by enacting more environmentally responsible policies that curb greenhouse gas emission.My best guess is that they don't want to pay for those pesky environmental studies and follow those environmental guidelines. So, moneyCheaper to just delete all those studies, and remove all mention of "Climate Change" from their guidelines.It's even cheaper to just slowly cut the EPA's budget to the point where they won't be able to regulate anything (and barely anyone will notice). Besides, aren't all studies online these days?Or just pass laws that forbid them from going after polluting companies, like they did to the DEA.Trump's swamp wants to gobble up as much money as they can before it gets drained. So if we don’t talk about climate change then it isn’t happening? Why can’t we use the same approach to deal with terrorism, Iran, and tax cuts for wealthy people?Or immigration, good gracious... could you imagine how the reds would light on fire if we just decided to not talk about one of their pet issues?Elections have consequences, people should have thought about this when they were equivocating between Trump and Clinton.Some of us did think about this.  Trumps pre-electrion "Climate change is a hoax by China." was a pretty big clue.Or him stating that he believes torture is effective.The problem is they did.  The core of the country swallowed up what they were shoveled day in and day out.  It was only one or two major campaign blunders but the Russians, the GOP, and the news media kept it front and center by doling out the information slowly. All while completely ignoring Trumps indiscretions. "All while completely ignoring Trumps indiscretions."what? they ere all in the news. a large minority didn't care.They didn't care because they weren't hammered with them for weeks at a time.  I think we could have used a lot more coverage on rape allegations that were filed in NY.  This didn't even get a day of traction.  Then his "Grab 'em by the pussy" I mean Bill Clinton was nearly impeached for getting a consentual blowjob in the oval and lying about it, yet Trump assaults women and that's fake news.  He has lied to the American people every step of the way on everything he does and been found out, but yet nothing comes of it.  I'm floored that we don't expect more from our representative. Republican voters are smarter voters, they kept their eye on the ball; and didn’t let the distractions affect them.No, they aren't.  Unless you make over 250K a year, you got hosed Tommy. Why are you considering only economic issues, why aren't you considering social issues. In that aspect they certainly won. If their goal was to create more disenfranchised poor that will probably turn  to crime to make ends meet.If their goal was to let millions of people die because they can't afford Healthcare.If their goal was to prevent easy access to medical aid for pregnant women.If their goal was to make future generations dumber by gutting education.Yep, winning so hard. If their goal was to keep brown people out.If their goal was to turn it into a Christian nation.If their goal was to prevent whites from losing powerIf their goal to prevent abortionsYeah they undoubtedly won.lol of course you turned out to be racistUnlike you calling me a racist, I think I'm fully justified in calling you stupid. Their eye on the ball? WTF is the ball in your scenario? Removing the middle class? make the rich river? backing an economic system that has been proven to fail?If the ball is jobs, then they should have voted for the candidate that who had a written plan on how communities can pivot, including the budget on how to do so. Just to be clear, that was Hillary.Stupid voters voted Trump. That's not an (R) or (D) statement. That's a Trump statement. The mans bullshit is documented, bit idiots don't care about actual proof.The middle class and poor who voted for Trump literally voted against themselves.Disagree completely. I don't buy this whole argument that there are significant amounts of independent voters. By the time the election season rolls around, all voters have made up their minds, even if they don't admit it to themselves. It's all just matter of motivation and getting to the polls. If you can get more Democratic inclined voters to the polls, they win otherwise the Republicans Win if they get more. It all comes down to voter motivation, which is what I mean about the eye on the ball. Also to a large section of the population, social issues are more important than economic ones.Yes, and the people who didn't vote for Trump (the majority) are the ones who actually care about social issues. No.repiblicans care more about their social issues. That’s why they voted that way.More accurate to say that they care about preventing social issues from getting fixed. I think 2016 proved that Republican voters are either greedy as fuck or dumb as shit. Supreme Court slots. I reluctantly voted for Clinton. For several reasons.One: I dislike families in the white house. We've already had the Clintons, the Bushes, and now the Trumps. Although Trump is the first Trump to hold office.Second, I had a feeling she would lose because she's a woman. It's just a fact that she entered a tense race with a handicap because of her gender.3rd: the Dems royally messed up by not nominating Bernie. He was ahead of Clinton and she simply had more money than he did. I have no doubt that man vs. man Bernie vs. Donald, that we would have a POTUS who is competent.I don't like Clinton at all, neither does anyone else in my family. There's only one reason I voted for her, Supreme Court. Trump will now likely replace 2 liberal justices on the court before his term is up. That'll be fun for the next 20+ years. Murdering babies (Clinton's full term abortion support) or destroying the environment. Decisions, decisions.1. Abortion rate is at an all time low. Climate change can potentially destroy our very way of life.2. Policy regarding abortion can be changed in an instant. Climate change will probably effect us for centuries.Is it really that hard of a decision?Yes a very hard decision. There was a shit ton of things wrong with Hillary, too numerous to count. I voted for Johnson cause I'd never give that walking scandal a vote.I mean I voted for Trump, so I’m not going to judge.No worries guys, Trump's going to save us by blanketing the planet in Nuclear Winter. At least that would help to cool off the planet. 4d chess??Patrolling the Mojave almost makes me wish for one...Mojave brothers, unite!Yeah that shit sucks. Almost as bad as running ranges over and over and over. Sometimes when I'm peacefully asleep I get jolted awake to a ghostly GO BACK! By doing what? Yesterday he was friends with the Russians.By pissing off the only man that is as insecure as him.NK doesn't have the firepower to make a nuclear winter.No but them firing gives Trump the excuse to use that kind of firepower. Still not enough for a nuclear winter.I mean, he still is. What the person you responded to meant, however, was war with North Korea.That won't be a nuclear winter. The follow up exchange from China when they realize their country is being covered in radioactive ash may be an issue.North Korea has maybe 10 small nukes that can't even hit the US. How are you gonna make a nuclear winter with that?Just ignore, you will get dizzy trying to keep track of the position changes.They cancelled it?  You don't say...  That's a pretty surprising move.Thing is even if you are a die hard GOP voter renewable tech is inevitable and by voting for a party that wants to march backwards you're basically saying "I really hope someday to be provided electricity by the Chinese."But hey, at least you don't have deleted emails to worry about.It's like in Canada. Morneau is a thieving asshole.  But at least (outside of Alberta) we're not hell bent on marching backwards (more like a zig-zag).  I'd rather have the highly educated thieving bastard than the illiterate orange bumblefuck you call a POTUS.simple equation. If sheer incompetence is indistinguishable from malice, then vote for the intelligent asshole because at least their malice will be structured and tangentially beneficial to your country.Don't get me wrong I'd rather not have a thief and just have an educated reasonable person as a politician... but given the choice ... at least the respectable thief is more likely to get progressive things done.&gt;have an educated reasonable person as a politicianAt least a the top, this hasn't happened in my lifetime :(I rather like your Elizabeth Warren though.Have to keep people stupid and unaware.  That way, they continue to vote for people like Trump.I disagree. There are a lot of informed voters that voted for President Trump in this election for three main reasons: 1. A Conservative SCOTUS majority. 2. Rising Obamacare premiums 3. Patriotism and love of country.If the Democrats ever want to try and get the voters back that voted for President Obama and switched to Trump, the first step would be to nominate a candidate that wears a flag pin and shows that they love this country. Hillary never expressed that love, she sounded unauthentic, and couldn’t inspire enough enthusiasm to win an election.It’s also worth noting that this was very predictable. Democrats have lost over 1,100 seats since the 2010 midterm elections. The Conservative tea party like movement started well before Trump, he was the pick of the people because unlike previous Republican candidates, he fights back. He will push back against the Democrats and liberal media bias and he gave these people a voice. Although brash at times, he says what a lot of people are thinking. &gt;1. A Conservative SCOTUS majority.So essentially treating politics as a sport, which isn't something informed voters should be doing.&gt;2. Rising Obamacare premiumshealthcare ALWAYS fluctuates, especially when elections occur.&gt;3. Patriotism and love of country.I think this one is the most hilarious excuse, since nothing is more vile and disrespectful to the US than Trump's presidency.  Trump has zero interest in the US as a whole and is only doing things to benefit his own interest.  He does not care nor does he have the motivation to learn to care.&gt;Hillary never expressed that love, she sounded unauthentic, and couldn’t inspire enough enthusiasm to win an election.What are you expecting from a presidential candidate, exactly?  Someone who is constantly on Uncle Sam's dick? And how petty do you have to be to not elect someone just because they aren't wearing a flag on their suit? (Which by the way, having a flag pin is actually disrespectful to the US flag under §176).Now, I'm not saying Hilary was the best choice by any means - However, no one has a legitimate excuse for electing someone unfit for the position they're in.  It's either absolute ignorance or arrogance.  Healthcare costs aren't  fluctuating. Its been rising since the implementation of the ACA.It's been rising literally your whole life I'd bet. Obamacare was implemented to slow the rise, and it did that. It increased dramatically under the ACA. Not to mention tge ACA was supposed to make healthcare cheaper."If the public isn't going to bow to our narrative, then NOBODY can have it!"-E.P.A. chief, probably.fuck all you cunts of the GOP. and anyone else who thinks the EPA is unwanted or unnecessary. rich people already do what they want the EPA is the only agency we have that tries to protect the greenI'll take that "fuck you" to me and just not give a shit. How about that?Okay, so you're more interestes in making liberals mad than avoiding the problems of climate change. God that's sad. No, I don't feel "climate change" is a big deal.And people claim that the US doesn't like to emulate other countries. Dear American friends, look up Stephen Fucking Harper and his muzzle of scientists in Canada. Same exact crap.Fight this bullshit. We are fighting.  We're fighting with every option available to us short of revolution.  Newsflash, if we did revolt into civil war, the ones with guns are all on the other side.  The biggest problem is the market, right now it's growing every day.  Turns out it's really profitable to remove all regulation and do whatever you want to the environment.Same with Tony Abbott in Australia, the first thing he did was remove the science ministry which had been there for over 70 years until then.   Pruitt will soon complain that EPA scientist don't participate in national events.....exactly, so he can then talk about how they refuse to do their jobs (because trumpster supporters wont look into it) and then fire them all while claiming the EPA is saving more money than ever before.He is going to be the death of many many people in the future or far future.OMG, it is getting worse every day. Not surprising. Trump and his cronies believe China is to blame. I can’t wait for Mar-a-Lago to be under 50 feet of water. Fat prick. Can we just fuckn eliminate this president and his staff already?  He’s literally done nothing positive.  Will someone name something positive that he’s done for this country?Must protect the profits of fossil fuels at all cost.  What a sad fucking joke Trump has made the EPA. What a sad joke he has made America. You are witnessing the rise of the ignorant and proud. I am wondering what a green party voter will do next election. Continue to vote green party or vote for someone that will not only stop what this administration is doing but might actually care about environmental issues.Thanks a lot willful ignorance. I realize its cool to be dumb right now, but you're really fuckin our shit up. the epa is scrubbing climate science in america, meanwhile china is closing down factories in a crackdown on pollution. shit's all backwards.But both sides are the same.The state of political discourse in this country has evolved directly from GOP stradegies that go back several generations. Within this strategy,  science, nuance, common sense -humanity itself - are enemies.  As history demonstrates, the institutionalization of anti intellectual thought ultimately destroys the societies which embrace it. Future history, to the extent that it exists in one hundred years, will judge this period harshly and  rightly conclude the disasters now unfolding the result of human stupidity.save those money and use them on more important issuesI care more about current affairs, not something that happen 100 years laterMemo to all EPA employees, Our new climate change policy is as follows: Forced Ignorance.That is all.I would help fund this science and their jobs if these people will go and speak anyway Silly people blaming Trump like the EPA wasn't infiltrated with corporate interests for decades.Trump DESERVES every second of the criticism.He believes climate change is a chinese hoax.He appointed scott pruitt A.K.A big oil's bitch to head the department, who lobbied and sued the EPA for years.pruitt gutted the department and placed a gag order on any climate science reports, pruitt now wants to de-regulate nuclear energy, allowing them to contaminate the local area by 10x current levelsTrump ripped up the clean power plan, which prevented companies from polluting.Stop defending trump, especially when he and his team are actively poisoning you.Some of us have been around long enough to know this isn't a new thing and that a very publicized scapegoat like Trump just gives a free pass to all the other players.Still doesn't give trump a free pass to try and dismantle it even more.
Just for the sake of completeness, I think everyone in the area should be warned, not just the students. What, is there some kind of job-killing regulation that forces the state to mug your hard earned money to pay for warning you to not go in deadly toxic smoke you might not realize is incredibly dangerous until after it's far too late? If we just ignore the fire and let it burn out of control the free market is certain to sort it out just like the people of West Virginia want.Hey from the bottom of my heart, fuck you buddy. This state has been hand on the wheel drivin off a cliff by years of democratic leadership. And when giving the reigns, the Republican party decided to tax the working class with the largest state tax increase in state  history. We've been strung along by everybody after carrying America's power needs literally on our backs and in our lungs, and after being hung out to dry and bleed through the last administration, ok shut down every coal plant, I'm with you. But when left with absolutely no economic stimulus except government programs other business that supports the coal industry dry up and these men and women are turning to heroin  We have the oldest State in the union meaning we have more elderly here than anywhere, and prescription opioid abuse is over 4 times the national average here. Our state has NO youth and even worse nothing for our youth to dream to become. And fucking forgive us if we want to get out of this problem with our own feet because clearly it feels like we've been left alone. So if you don't have anything constructive or helpful wed appreciate you to shut the fuck up and quite buying heroin, then our state might livethe state should pick itsell up by the bootstraps and stop complaining. the vast majority of states have avoided the pitfalls your state ran into head first with glee and a "fuck you" for anybody who tried to warn them. You voted for this state of deregulation and now you need to deal with it. unfortunately, like always, a moocher state is going to demand a functioning state bail them out. Again. &gt; Hey from the bottom of my heart, fuck you buddy.Why? I'm completely agreeing with your political philosophy and your political demands. Let them burn, let them suffer, let them die and let the free market sort it out. Let's skip the hypocritical handouts and the fuck you I got mine stage immediately after when someone other than them needs help too. Let's get straight to the free market making America great again. Which, ironically, will probably look an awful lot like the liberal solutions when people get sick of suffering for no fucking reason except they're too stupid to demand anything else.They'd not hesitate to vote for *my* family to be left for dead. Even if I vote to help *them* personally. Why shouldn't I vote to leave their families for dead until they learn that shit works both ways?Parkersburg resident here. The first two days a lot of the smoke flew over my house and most of it came down in a nearby city called Vienna. Today it started raining so all that smoke is just outside my house. It's so bad I can hardly breathe out there without having a tissue over my mouth. Things aren't too bad once I get inside, but I can only hope it stays that way...Well, at least there was profit to be made once those pesky regulations were jettisoned. Whew!
Really hope they catch this sonofabitch. No apparent motive, just walks up behind people on the street with a bag over his head and shoots them several times. Seems like he's just killing people for the hell of it. I'm in Tampa and it's putting everyone on edge here. I live in Seminole Heights, shit is happening right around the corner. Not cool to be afraid to take the trash to the curb after dark. Bruh, I'd be boarding windows and clearing out the crowsnest upstairs. Neighborhood watch is the most useful tool you could possibly have in a situation like this. You people need vantage points and loudspeakers with people taking shifts through the night. Nothing is more potent than protecting eachother&gt; Bruh, I'd be boarding windows and clearing out the crowsnest upstairs. Neighborhood watch is the most useful tool you could possibly have in a situation like this. You people need vantage points and loudspeakers with people taking shifts through the night. Nothing is more potent than protecting eachotherBut what happens when the serial killer is part of the neighborhood watch, and it's his turn to...watch. Coming this Fall. I'd watch it.There's a group of volunteer armed citizens, a lot are vets, called "guardian angels" who wear uniforms and have been patrolling and escorting citizens. It's something at least.      &gt; armed citizens, a lot are vets, called "guardian angels" who wear uniformsThat's just chickenshit theatrics.

How would you know?Be brave and be vigilant as you are. No need to put on a damn parade of frightened and armed, trigger-happy assholes.The killer is more potent! Right now he's unstoppable!Lmao all of that for one mortal man with a gun? Yeah no kidding, it sucks. Hope this fucker is caught soon!Shit I worry about getting stabbed in the face when I step out the door at night, can't imagine how many bricks I'd shit if something like that was going on for real.&gt; Really hope they catch this sonofabitch. No apparent motive, just walks up behind people on the street with a bag over his head and shoots them several times. Seems like he's just killing people for the hell of it.The motive and shootings sound very much like the Phoenix Serial Street Shooter, who would shoot random people at night. He was active in the Phoenix area in 2016 - possible he moved to Tampa and became active again? I don't recall he was ever caught, and most leads went cold. Could be. It could honestly be anyone. Hope they are caught soon!&gt; Could be. It could honestly be anyone. Hope they are caught soon!The Daytona Beach Killer also had a similar motive, though he would kill prostitutes in his car, execution style, not like the Phoenix Serial Street Shooter who matches the Tampa serial killings to a T. Wow, maybe. I'm sure with the police and FBI both investigating, they have probably contacted AZ law enforcement and/or requested case files for comparison. This is some scary shit.&gt; Wow, maybe. I'm sure with the police and FBI both investigating, they have probably contacted AZ law enforcement and/or requested case files for comparison. This is some scary shit.Very likely. They have one guy in custody that they believe is the Phoneix Serial Street Shooter, but considering those shootings took place between 2015 and July 2016, and the alleged shooter was charged in 2017, perhaps that was a trigger for the Tampa serial street shooter. Who knows, but hopefully he's caught soon. http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-breaking/2017/06/30/aaron-saucedo-officially-charged-serial-street-shooter-murders/443027001/&gt; http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-breaking/2017/06/30/aaron-saucedo-officially-charged-serial-street-shooter-murders/443027001/The only solid evidence that we know of exists in the killing of his mothers boyfriend, not the other random/unconnected murders, and the evidence uncovered so far seems shaky as it is (guns owned in similar caliber to those used in the shootings, and having owned a black BMW during the time of the shootings). Having had Saucedo charged with the murders in Phoenix would have been the perfect cover for the actual PSSS to go cold, only to resurface in Tampa - with the same exact motive/grouping.I'm not saying Saucedo ISN'T the PSSS, but also not willing to say that the TBSSS isn't the PSSS - or perhaps a copycat, but the grainy footage of the TBSSS released matches what one would think the  sketches of the PSSS have as a body. They caught someone in May.

The only solid murder (and which does not fit the pattern of the serial killings) was the murder of his mothers boyfriend.

Well if mercury is in retrograde and your moon house is actually a bounce castle then maybe...So scary.Stay safe, Tampa residents. Hope the effer is found soon... like now. Dugan: I'm very cautious with that term because we don't have enough information.CBS: Serial killer may be at large!Yeah, it's not really fair to go throwing around words like "large" when we don't have enough data yet.Yeah, I didn't understand this article.  The police chief says he's not willing to call it a serial killer but in the prior sentence they state police say there may be a serial killer at large. Um, no he didn't.Reminds me of the DC Sniper. I lived there during that time and it was crazy to feel the way we all did about going out. My buddy’s dad had actually seen the sniper’s Monte Carlo at the area where it was parked when they caught the guy several weeks before. He only took notice because he also had a Monte Carlo. My sister and her husband live in Tampa, strange that we’d both go through something like this in our lives. Where the fuck is Serge when you need him?Hope to shit no idiots put bags over their head as a joke, they'll get their asses shot.Halloween coming up as well, so probably likely some tit will.Halloween is when he's planning his grand strike on Tampa. If we don't move quick, All Hallows' Eve is when all hell breaks loose.Wheels up in 30.The police are literally handing out lights so you can keep your porch light on. Having to bring iron when taking out the trash or just coming home every night from work is annoying the hell out of me.Try Aluminum, it's a lighter material....but it doesn't deal as well with SAAMI-spec ammo.I'm pretty sure S&amp;W make a P+ aluminum snubby, which is more then you need honestly. Not far from me, but he might start mixing it up since they're all in the same place. That’s what I was thinking especially knowing (well, maybe) police are active in that area This reminds me of the D.C. sniper.I live in Lakeland, which is a little ways away, but this is concerning, especially since I have friends and family in Tampa.Gang initiation? These kinds of things only begin to (publicly) make sense retrospectively. The thing about gang initiation is you kill to prove you have the heart and will to be trusted in the gang, not to bring national attention to yourself.I was implying the connection was the neighborhood rather than the shooter. Not at all familiar with the area though.  But nothing about a sidewalk shooting screams "ritualistic" to me based on the article. No staging, nothing. Just whack em and leave em. That's weird. Even using a gun is weird in terms of serial killers. It's so impersonal, and the history of serial killing just outright disagrees with that as a method.  Gang initiation (more than 1 shooter) would make more sense to me.  But that's why I said retrospectively it might come together a bit more. They can't release connecting details while they investigate. &gt; I was implying the connection was the neighborhood rather than the shooter. Not at all familiar with the area though.&gt; But nothing about a sidewalk shooting screams "ritualistic" to me based on the article. No staging, nothing. Just whack em and leave em.

You typically see the use of a gun (from a distance or not) when the killer wants to feed their need to kill but is either too meek, socially awkward, or mentally weak / disgusted by their actions to do so in a more personal manner. The neighborhood itself is suburban and typically not all that dangerous, but I could see your point if this were a worse part of town.There's a wrong side of the highway though that's for certain. I don't know if that's where the murders were exactly but Seminole heights isn't peaches and Daisies. Having an unarmed society would totally prevent this because there is no way a criminal can ever obtain something illegally!This is on top of Florida's normal serial killer...

Serial killers and mass shooters are two different things if this is what you are referring to&gt; Serial killers and mass shooters are two different things if this is what you are referring toI edited my original comment to include the following list of serial killers (a few of which are dead-end/cold cases):* Darren Deon Vann* The Craigslist Ripper* Israel Keyes* Terry Blair* Anthony Sowell / The Cleveland Strangler* Michael Gargiulo / The Hollywood Stabber* Maury Travis / The Map Killer* Seven Bridges Killer* Lorenzo Montoya / West Mesa Murderer* Sean Vincent GillisSource: https://www.ranker.com/list/21st-century-serial-killers/ranker-crimeI didn't know this thank you for the sourceI have heard before that the FBI estimates there are around 50 active serial killers in the US at any given time. According to John Douglas, who worked for the FBI, "A very conservative estimate is that there are between 35 and 50 active serial killers in the United States" at any given time."https://www.creators.com/read/diane-dimond/01/12/serial-killers-how-many-are-thereThere's been plenty of serial killers since the 90's. We just haven't had a case of an especially fucked up Dahmer type in awhile.We have, but it kinda went unnoticed. Is that even true?  If it is I'd imagine we just haven't seen them, as in caught them.  I'm not sure the stats on serial killers but I imagine they happen enough to make the "none since the late 90s" statement incorrect.  Can someone give a good source for serial killer data?  And don't bring this comment up when I'm running for President.Too lazy too google myself but the FBI tracks such things.  We've seen plenty of serial killers since the 90s. Check out mindhunter on Netflix. There was a huge study in the 70s to try and answer that question. Mindhunter is about the two FBI agents in the behavorial sciences unit and their work on criminal profiling. They interviewed serial killers to gain insights into their motives.Great show Sometimes I wonder if modern would-be serial killers just to take to mass-shootings instead.  The term "copycat killer" was [originally coined](https://people.howstuffworks.com/5-copycat-killers.htm) for serial killers who followed in the footsteps of Jack the Ripper.  Over the years many serial killers were known to emulate those that came before them.It may simply be that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold of Columbine fame are the modern 'rippers' inspiring a new generation of killers.  Except instead of killing people one at a time from the shadows over the course of months or years, they do it all in one spectacular made-for-tv act.Mass shooters are actually committing suicide. They don't expect to make it out alive. Serial killers have different motivations generally. We have plenty of both, j think the former is just getting more media coverage these days, which ironically acts as incentive for that type of person[It's crazy that this country actually has unsolved mass murders.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Unsolved_mass_murders_in_the_United_States)It seems most serial killers are sexually motivated, so they wouldn't satisfy that need with a mass shooting. They want to be around for the aftermath, to indulge in the memory of what the did, plan another one.
Is this irony? Maybe if the rhino cuts off the poachers nose and leaves him to bleed to death. Maybe his human horn.Nice.  If you are going to make sweet love to an Omnicronian you better have some human horn.Or maybe even his, uhh.. wing-dang-doodle?Harvest the lower horn!Death by snu-snu!http://www.reactiongifs.us/death-by-snu-snu-futurama/^^I'm ^^scare-roused"Hmm, doesn't seem very remarkable.""That's what SHE said!"Ok.  You can have my nose!Yes.  This guy watches Futurama.This guy Matt Groen'sThe phallus of a poacher is considered an aphrodisiac by rhino populations after allIt really gets them horny. Rhino horns are actually keratin and can be safely harvested and regrow if the rhino is sedated by a trained vet. Cutting lower may prevent regrowth. This is why many rhinos have horns cut-to prevent poachers from attacking something due to lack of horn.Ivory elephant tusks are modified incisors and contain nerves and blood vessels, so removal leads to bleeding and infection.Even then, poachers will kill/sedate "trimmed" rhinos and remove the stump as well.Is that a rhinoplasty?Pity the real criminals are in Asia.The poacher is some poor dude, living off scraps, whilst some big conglomerate, is making billions. Laws against ivory trade inept. And some collector or religious moron, is using it for muti healing, or decoration.And then the Americans, obsession with lion canned hunting is the other problem.No, the guy killing rhinos is also a real criminalYeah, coincidentally I just saw this post after watching a show about Rhino poachers, and they said the same syndicates are also into drugs, human trafficking, and all manner of horribleness.If you're willing to try to profit off illegal activities, you might as well go all in and just diversify your crime portfolio.Rhinos have no ivory, but close enough Man, I thought for a second you meant hunting lions to can their meat.

I hear a dwarfs cock has magic powers.the poacher lives until we find a cock merchantI think you can find one in the capital of Thailand. Peter Dinklage= Confirmed stud.Pity the rhino didn't just stomp him to death.I feel like we get some story about an elephant trampling a big game hunter semi-regularly.Yeah but usually that's a guy who paid to legally shoot an old male elephant to promote the health of the herdIn this case it was an asshole trying to illegal kill Rhinos. Fuck that guy.It happened once with an old male rhino, not an old male elephant. And there is no reason to expect rhinoceri in the wild ever stop breeding: in captivity they can live long enough that they become infertile, but this almost never happens in the wild. In other words that rhino was a breeding male.[Old elephants are the same case](http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2013/10/28/3874904.htm): in fact it’s even worse to shoot old elephants, as they are absolutely necessary for elephant societies to function.http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/10/151017-zimbabwe-elephant-tusker-trophy-hunting-poaching-conservation-africa-ivory-trade/So the argument trophy hunting benefits the population by removing unnecessary or detrimental animals is a myth. Finally, animals shot by trophy hunters are never geriatric: animals that old *look* geriatric and make poor trophy material. Younger males in their prime are the usual targets. The problem with old bulls is not they they become infertile, rather they simply get old. When they're old they have less energy and a lower libito meaning they physically can't mate with as many females as a younger bull. This means that while the older bull is still around he will claim all the females he did when he was younger but cant mate with them all and this means less females are impregnated. So yes while old bulls can still mate, keeping them around too far past their prime can cause a heard to thin because they just can't do it like they used to and the young bulls who can replace them can. Source: Volunteered on a game reserve in South AfricaBut most bulls die before they get that old, and if they do get that old, they get kicked out by younger bulls.Not to mention elephant society is built on the backs of elders and killing them, even if they do not breed, has severe results. (see the Pilhanesberg elephants for an example)Why assume what you were taught wasn't either done with a secret agenda or just out of date?Its very rare that a young bull will be able to force out and older one. Also packs of elephants are lead by females and the elder females are the ones that are really integral to their society not the males.&gt;Its very rare that a young bull will be able to force out and older oneBecause in the wild most older bulls aren't so old as to be unable to breed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#Sexual_behaviour&gt;Bulls engage in a behaviour known as mate-guarding, where they follow oestrous females and defend them from other males.[128] Most mate-guarding is done by musth males, and females actively seek to be guarded by them, **particularly older ones**.[129] Thus these bulls have more reproductive success.[120]http://www.elephant-world.com/elephant-reproduction/&gt; The older males that are from 40 to 50 years of age are the most likely to breed with the females. The females are ready to breed when they are about 14 years of age.[Male elephant societies are actually complex.](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141101-male-elephants-have-a-sweet-side)The ability to breed isnt in question. Its how many females a bull can breed with vs how many its "claiming" &gt;Bulls engage in a behaviour known as mate-guarding, where they follow oestrous females and defend them from other males.[128] Most mate-guarding is done by musth males, and females actively seek to be guarded by them, **particularly older ones**.[129] Thus these bulls have more reproductive success.[120]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#Sexual_behaviourSo the old ones breed with more females.&gt;  Thus ***these bulls*** have more reproductive success.[120]An individual having more success to the detriment of others doesn't mean *the herd* is healthier for it.(making up numbers) Old bull holds onto 12 females but can only mate with 5 and keeps two young bulls from breeding the remaining 7. In this case the old bull has more reproductive success. Versus, old bull gone, genetics have been spread into the herd for a few years, two young bulls come up and have the opportunity to each  hold and mate with 6 females.  In this case the herd is better off. Just because an elephant will mate guard a female doesnt mean it will be able to successfully mate with it. The other problem there is that male usually go into musth around 25 and will fight other bulls to the death and they actually can end up killing enough young bulls to slow the population growth."Why assume what you were taught wasn't either done with a secret agenda or just out of date?" - /u/IamnotburgerkingOld *female* elephants.

Circle of lifeThank you. Reddit members have somehow convinced themselves that all these rich, bored american blood-thirsty people who travel halfway across the world for the sole pleasure of shooting an animal are necessary and doing so for a greater good, and not because they simply enjoy killing.I mean, maybe the science backs this up, but I still think it's funny that humans get to decide what's best for the animal kingdom. It seemed to be doing fine before we showed up.I am having a hard time taking you seriously because everything I've read about high-fee conservation hunting and the officials in various African countries who manage it contradicts everything you are saying.Honestly you sound like some PETA fuck trying to spread an anti-hunting message without providing any proof that conservation hunting isn't what it says it is.Many African nations are corrupted, why trust their officials?Conservation organizations are divided.Some "safari guides" that market themselves to foreign hunters have been known to be scammers/unlicensed/illegal. They are tracked down and prosecuted when possible. Animals that they cause to be killed are accounted for in future management planning.That doesn't mean the actual officials are doing a bad job with the licensed hunts. In fact, they have a vested monetary interest in maintaining their animal populations simply because of the fees they can charge for the occasional hunt. Even if not all of the money makes it back into wildlife management funds, that's better than zero money, especially in those economies where budgets are small and wildlife management isn't the top daily priority.The best argument I can give is that as long as it's financially beneficial for them to keep a healthy wildlife around, they will do so.I don't think they'd care too much if the money came from tourists, philanthropists or hunters. But as long as they're getting paid, they have an interest in the health of the herd.[deleted]The point is that legal trophy hunting ALSO kills animals that shouldn’t be killed, because a) old animals do breed and b) trophy animals are not old animals. So your argument that trophy hunting is justified while poaching isn’t is wrong: both are unjustified conservation-wise. I'm not sure where you're getting this idea that safari hunters only target "trophies." Conservation hunting doesn't necessarily target trophies. With conservation hunting the targets are selected by wildlife conservation management officials in various governments, and they sell high-fee licenses to people with the money and desire to hunt them. This money helps fund further conservation efforts. They usually target problem animals, regardless of whether that problem animal can breed. Fertility is only one factor.The officials themselves could hunt them of course, but then this would be throwing away an opportunity to bring in much-needed funding.The problem is that that is all in theory and doesn’t happen in practice. Yeah. I'm a supporter of conversation hunting, fuck poachers right in the ass!I will never understand how people think it is necessary to kill old male elephants to promote breeding. How the hell do you think elephants got by without us around to... kill them?It truly does not make sense. Yes, I have done my research.Yes for milliena humans did not take up much of their habitat and therefore their kind could breed easier. But let's use deer as an example. They breed rapidly and their cycle is to over breed then die out from starving. Thus the strongest and smartest survives.Elephants need to be culled now because their habitat has diminished so that one male does cause issues with breeding.It might have unexpected side effects though.Elephants learn from experience and are taught by their elders, so you can't really think of them purely in terms of numbers and breeding.  Killing the old ones could alter the society.  It might, for instance, make the society more aggressive overall if the young males are all taught how to be an elephant-man by middle-agers and there are no elders around.There isn't any easy answer to the problem, unfortunately.  Aside from not destroying their habitat, obviously.These are great points and I agree. I think it depends on the agressiveness of the older male.I don’t think many argue it’s necessary exactly. More that it increases the rate of population growth to do so. And it only makes my justice boner rage harder. He wanted horn, he got hornDamn, I wish it killed that piece of shit. I wish they would interrogate him used any and all means to find and capture everyone he works for/with.Ok, but we still get to kill him afterwards. Deal?We? No. The rhino should get to do it. That's a little harsh. What if he only became a poacher because this very same rhino shot his parents when he was a child?If only all animals would kill their torturers, lol.I still say this could be an opportunity.Let all those rich western big game hunters hunt poachers instead. At least then they'll be doing something that benefits others for a change.I’d love to watch a series on hunting poachers, “The Deadliest Game”, being my suggested title.  Trademarked before Discovery or TLC tried to poach my idea. Sounds like we have a good compromise right here&gt;implying that big game hunters don't bring a shit ton of money into otherwise destitute areas.I get that not all big game hunters are great people, but it's often portrayed as if there's nothing of value from that industry. Those animals would get killed one way or another, and at least through the legal means hunters go through, poor countries get some revenue from it and actually put a lot of that money into sustaining the population of these animals they hunt. I know that the guides are the ones that benefit the most, but ask any local working for them if they'd rather do the alternative.I say cut off the guy’s lower horn and leave him in the sun to rot.I wished he trampled his shooting arm to the point of uselessness.Fucking poaching fucks."Reversal of fortunes" is kind of an odd phrase to use here. It lends the article a philosophical tone.He hit him woth a GORETurnabout is fair playThat Rhino needs a medal. Well...human horn is an aphrodisiac.Rhino: the other other white meat.This should be on the uplifting news sub His leg should not have been treated. They should have let it get infected and let him die laying in the dirt, just like he planned for the rhino. Good. Hunter Beware. That show on CBS where the animals take over is a documentary.The writing sucks the actors act the shit outa the poor writing though. I fucking love how each season it gets wackier and wackier. I read the book before watching it and going into season 2 i began to lose my shit with the earthquake sloth. I still don't get it I don't even think the actors get itYeah, I stopped watching when those weird hybrid animals came in. Too weird for me.So there is justice in the worldDid the rhino cut off the poacher's human horn and sell it on the intergalactic black market?Hahaha, yes!HARVEST THAT HUMAN'S SMALL LOWER HORN!(That's what she said,.. whhooooo)This is even better than when the bulls gore the matador to death.Personally, I think people that are just *found* in those national parks illegally should be summarily executed.And then I get really steamed when I think about the fact that powdered rhino horn is primarily used as a hangover remedy.r/JusticeServed ?The newspaper said the rhino "appeared from nowhere"Clever girl!R-K-O.....from outta nowhere!You mess with the rhino...damn this one is too easy.Someone needs to draw a stick figure on the side of the rhino and put a little line through it.Ya know, I think I have a solution to all of the militia gun nuts in America. Instead of sitting there polishing their rifles waiting for Antifa, or the second coming of the American Civil War, you go out to African nations on rotation. You'd set up in or near reserves and poach the poachers / defend the animals. The park wardens already have their hands full fighting poachers armed to the teeth. You'd get to help the environment and fire your weapons. It's a win/win.I hope he gets interrogated by the police and he cracks so he can tattle on all of the big fish.https://youtu.be/UsgP5DouB2MYeah if you see something like that and decide to fuck with it, your ass deserves injury.ITT: human horn jokes. this is wonderful newsNot so great for the world. We got quite a bit of stupid humans, and population control is a must. Next time, kill the human, rhino team!!Yeah screw you poacherMy takeaway is to grind up my fingernails and sell it as fake rhino horn in Asia.  Make some money off these chumps.is it true :) The suspect's friends found refuge for him on a nearby mountain and police arrested him there, a day after he was injured. Muharukua is being treated at a hospital under police guard.Standing with my enemyHung on my hornsWith haste and reverieKilling with charmI hope the poacher recovers. Learns from this, and goes on to better himself. For his sake and the sake of his family, and of course the sake of any members of endangered species he may have killed in the future. Only injured, that's too bad.I love hunting accidents, this one is disappointing.  Oh well.Damn the poacher lived :/ Since all it takes to decimate a population of rhinos seems to be the 'medicinal' superstition of a handful of Asian millionaires that is unlikely to go away anytime soon, would it be more effective to surgically remove and destroy the horns of the remaining populace? I wish it wouldn't come to this but it seems as though it only takes a handful of people with money to continue the this sad tradition.Devil's advocate: an experiment in downvoting-Poaching is one of the things that across the board is really easy to outright condemn. And I agree, I work in the field of wildlife conservation, so I experience this first hand.For a moment, however, consider a couple points. One, I didn't see if it says in this case, but for the most part, poachers in Africa tend to be locals or at least from the country they poach in. Imagine, this guy could have a wife and children that he's trying to feed, and with no other legitimate work around, turns to poaching. The job markets there aren't quite as accessible as they are in the first world. Not making excuses for these people, but trying to bring some humanity that is otherwise not considered. It's easy to say "fuck it kill em all" but it's quite uncommon for these guys just to be mustache twirling villains that kill solely for the fun of it.Second, who's really at fault here, the poacher, or the huge culture demanding these products for a useless commodity? Should we focus more efforts on punishing poachers, or on reducing the market, thereby decreasing the poaching going on? Just some thoughts I find worthy of consideration.I would just like to point out that the article starts with "Nairobi - KENYA", while the incident happened in Namibia.That would be like the article listing the location as Oakland while the incident actually happened somewhere in Canada.That city is where the press office is based, not where the story happened.  The journalist who wrote that article is based in Nairobi, that’s all.MmmmNot too happy - I’d honestly be happier if the poacher died a slow painful death.After all the other rhinos that died one guy got  injured while trying to poach another ‘catch’. Hardly fair if u ask me.Todays score:     Human  0           Rhino    1

Am I missing something, or did we all just like Dr. Strangelove so much that we need to get back to 1963? Keeping missiles, planes, and subs is a big part of why our system works, because you can’t really do anything about all three at once.Triad is what makes deterrence work.I think – I think, for me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me.Look, having nuclear—my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart—you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world—it’s true!—but when you're a conservative Republican they try—oh, do they do a number—that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune—you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged—but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me—it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right—who would have thought?), but when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners—now it used to be three, now it’s four—but when it was three and even now, I would have said it's all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don't, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years—but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.Yup that's our president alright.What a time to be alive.I need more Trump copypasta, that was incredible.Worst. Copypasta. *Ever*.  :'-(Minuteman is pretty dispersed, it's not like there's one silo you can just take out. When the enemy has thousands of warheads though they suddenly don't seem as dispersed with an opponent like North Korea obviously yes it's the Spurs but when you're talking about a state actor like Russia or China there was always a fear and as the Cold War ended it appeared a plausible fear that either through the use of slbms in a surprise launch or with highly accurate heavyweight weapons like the ss-18 many of if not all of the u.s. icbm's could have been crippled before launch. That's why you have submarines though no way in hell anyone is going to get all or even most of the submarines even in the best scenario and they hold enough Firepower to to still fuck you back to the Stone Age 10 times over and then do it again for good measure.I'm out of breath just reading thisWhat a nonsense statement. Deterrence works if an enemy believes you have the will and the ability to hit them back if they attack you. A "triad" doesn't magically make it any more effective. The point of keeping bombers on alert during the cold war was so that they could get off the ground ASAP is the Soviets launched their missiles. There is zero chance that the North Koreans will launch a first strike that destroys US nuclear forces, so this is just posturing. It'll probably cost a lot of money though that the military could be better spending on other things. 24 hour alert doesn't really change anything. All 24 hour alert is is they can be launched in 24 hours. It's not a 5 minute alert where the pilots sit in the cockpits. The most that will change is they will have a day they can't drink when it's their turn in the rotation.You should Google the different alert levels for our air force The planes are either A. Easier to use as a first strike, since you don’t know if the plane is going to use a missile or not until it does, where as a ICBM launch is a very straight forward “nuclear strike imminent” sign. B. Flying high and being refueled to be able to strike after the US has been struck and our silos destroyedAnd launched bombers can be recalled, ICBM's cannot.This is the most dangerous aspect of ICBMs.  You launch them and it's done.  And you only get something like 10 minutes to decide.  Planes can be recalled. Subs can wait and hide.  ICBMs are giant targets in the ground that will be totally unusable unless you launch them *now* and it injects added urgency into the situation. The nuclear powers will never give up their nuclear weapons.  But the world would be a lot safer if they all agreed to outlaw ICBMs.  They can have their subs and their planes, but fuck ICBMs. The whole point of ICBMs at this point are purely sponges. Make the enemy try to use as many resources as possible to get rid of the hundreds of hardened sites, because if they miss a couple, we can still retaliate.This is a really important point - the many military installations around the country (and world in the case of some nations) are as much about defense as offense.  The first strike always goes to military targets, not population centers, if you simply have an overwhelming number of military installations an enemy would need to target your population centers are much more secure.With the missiles you just need to kill the ghost before it hits, build more observers.Planes also have flexibility in strike payload by being able to be outfitted with different types of nuclear weapons.I'd like the green mushroom cloud and glitter combo please, the radiation will pass but they will be finding sparkly bits in their underwear for generations.Plus consider a situation like retaliatory strike against North Korea.  If you launch ICBM's towards North Korea you have to hope that China and Russia don't get nervous and interpret it as an attack against them.  You can recall a plan at the last second. Once an ICBM has been launched there's no turning back. Hence nuclear bombers are a major part of brinksmanship.General Turgidson, is there really a chance for that plane to get through?Mr. President, if I may speak freely, the rusky talks big but we think he's short of know how. You just can't expect a bunch of ignorant peons to understand a machine like some of our boys do, and that's not meant as an insult mr. ambassador. You take your average ruskee, we all know how much guts he's got. Hell, look at all them Nazis killed off and they still wouldn't quit!Can't you stick to the point General?Well, uh sir, if the pilots good, see--I mean if he's really sharp, he can barrel that baby so low, you oughta see it sometime, it's a sight!

It's how it's being said through non-official channels.  Normally, they're the ones telling everyone that it's psyop and to calm down.  Now they are telling people that it's time to remove personal assets from the area.  In other words, this time it's different.  And while Twitter and Reddit have picked up on it, the vast majority of the world hasn't.

In parts I and II, there were many combatant nations on each side. It would no doubt be a nuclear war, but unlike the Cold War between the USSR and the West, it appears (to me) that NK is pretty much on their own in this endeavor.  Does NK have any significant allies? In certain circumstances China would work with NK to prevent their emaciated and uneducated citizens from pooling into their country. A massive amount of refugees is a problem. War with the USA is a MUCH larger problem.That would literally be like jumping into a raging inferno because you were slightly cold.China wants us out of the area, so they will do their best to get that, but I can not see either of us purposefully tanking our economies just to kill ourselves.&gt; I can not see either of us purposefully tanking our economies just to kill ourselves.History provides disturbingly too many counter-examples.History is full of people who are stupider than Xi Jinping.Those racists!  Why on God's green earth would you want to keep millions of uneducated people from pouring into your country, going on welfare and voting for the party that promises to increase and extend your welfare benefits on the backs of the working class?!?MADNESS, I TELL YOU!  MADNESS!There may very well be states that align with NK to attack the US and whoever sides with the US even if they aren't traditional allies.  That seems to happen often during such major destabilizing wars.   I don't think you need to assume it would be nuclear. There are a lot of other options. And hopefully no one wants that.If China and Russia get sucked in it could get much more interesting:The UK joins by default because we always do.India joins UK side against China as do Austrailia and NZ.Pakistan would be in an odd position of being able to choose the side but would be forced to choose as:Iran and Syria would join Russia due to the now repercussion-free nukes in Israel but Iraq requires the US too much at this point as does Saudi Arabia. Kurdes are screwed.Turkey will either jump at the chance to show the EU it's a good boy and keep it's NATO commitments (better deal for US arms that can help in peace as well as war) or use the new Russia connections to reclaim some areas "lost" post-Ottoman empire. Both of which set off the NATO and EU defence policies opening up a front to start a good old European war.WWI was started for seemingly no good reason too. Masking out specific country and empire names, the Wikipedia intro to what started WWI might as well be describing the state of the world today:&gt; ... factors as political, territorial and economic conflicts, militarism, a complex web of alliances and alignments, imperialism, the growth of nationalism, and the power vacuum created by the decline of ... empire. Other important long-term or structural factors that are often studied include unresolved territorial disputes, the perceived breakdown of the balance of power ..., convoluted and fragmented governance, the arms races of the previous decades, and military planning. The immediate causes lay in decisions made by statesmen and generals during the ... crisis. Other factors that came into play during the diplomatic crisis that preceded the war included misperceptions of intent, fatalism that war was inevitable, and the speed of the crisis, which was exacerbated by delays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications.I mean, roughly speaking, a big country invaded a small country, but an alliance brought in Russia, which brought in France, which brought in England, etc. It was the worst string reaction possible.Reason is the reapearance of nationalists worldwide. Propaganda, brain wash, manipulation and the people buy the newest iphone and follow.The reason is so Trump can try to duck the Russia investigation. He's willing to start WWIII to try to get out of trouble. I can't bring myself to disagree with you.&gt; for no fucking reason?We're doing it for a reason. We're doing it because half of Americans were taught to hate the smart people. We're doing it because Millennials treated the election like a joke and voted for Harambe. We're doing it because of her emails. There's a billion reasons. I tried to warn everyone about this. But oh well.On the whole you're correct, but [the Harambe votes didn't actually happen](https://www.snopes.com/harambe-15000-votes/)Trump 2020: Do it for the LOLZIf we're stupid enough to do it once, we're stupid enough to do it twice. Happened with Bush, although I'd even take Bush at this point. At least Bush seems like a decent enough person, aside from whole Iraq thing. As much as Bush made some really serious mistakes, we have to remember that he had all of Congress backing him up for a long time. We have to start holding Congress accountable.I mean I’m sure many Trump voters in 2016 did it for that reason.There's also the fact that ***someone*** seems to desperately want to bring their presidential approval ratings from the mid 30%s to somewhere higher. And war usually drums up nationalism, which encourages blind allegiance to government/military authority. And, there's the studies that seem to indicate that fear is an important component of conservative ideology...["People embrace political conservatism (at least in part) because it serves to reduce fear, anxiety, and uncertainty; to avoid change, disruption, and ambiguity"](http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/jost.glaser.political-conservatism-as-motivated-social-cog.pdf)Edit: added linkBut I thought Hillary won the popular vote, which means the majority of people... Oh, never mind.This article seems to be a little bit sensationalist...How so?Goldfein and other senior defense officials stressed that the alert order had not been given, but that preparations were under way in anticipation that it might come. That decision would be made by Gen. John Hyten, the commander of U.S. Strategic Command, or Gen. Lori Robinson, the head of U.S. Northern CommandWorried at this because a) Millions will die for nothingb) Australia will get roped into thisc) i don't want to die/live in a post apocalyptic societyWell not a NUCLEAR post apocalyptic society, but how about a zombie post apocalyptic society?Only if they walk slow. Also I'm more worried about the humans then the zombies Basically Trump is creating a cold war where there wasn't one. Americans are having their lives played with and nearly half of them dont give a shit. Worse than not giving a shit, the idiots all for it because ‘lol libruls hate it’. Ridiculous.Russian propaganda may be the downfall of our entire country. But I'll be damned if it wasn't the Republicans who primed the propaganda machine and oiled it for years.Where have you been for the last ten years? The Russians have been in a Cold War with us in their minds that entire time. The core of their political elite are terrified by us and the future we represent. They despise the change to old orders we bring. So they have a mindset where 21st century technology to advocate for a1950's worldview while fearing a new Napoleon rising from the West. It's so backwards but they started it all on their own. Trump didn't start squat, you need look in to the halls inside the Kremlin to find those who did.I'm confused, is Russia not a problem now? Are they not meddling in politics of democratic countries? Did they not forcibly annex parts of their neighbors? Is their leader not running an oppressive and corrupt government?Did Russia help elect Trump or is Trump not involved with any Russian conspiracy theories?Why do you think these are for Russia?What part of the ongoing talk from Trump about "Fire and Fury" and annihilating North Korea makes you think these are in response to Russia?Because the article quotes a US military office talking about the current geopolitical climate and he cites both Nk and Russia. That's nice. Trump still hasn't enforced the sanctions that were lawfully passed. This has nothing to do with Russia. &gt; Why do you think these are for Russia?Because he read the article unlike ninety percent of the commentors here.Did you?  It specifically mentions North Korea as well, and given the political climate and Trump's boner for threatening NK, and consistent tip-toeoing around russia, you have to be pretty thick to think this is about Russia.Don’t forget, the calm before the storm.This is 100% about North Korea. It’s dick measuring time By that logic we're everybody's problem. You're not wrong.&gt; is Russia not a problem nowAs a former superpower trying to claw it way back, yes, it's always a country you can't ignore and you should keep an eye on. Same with China, India, and various other countries that aren't our close allies.&gt; Are they not meddling in politics of democratic countries? Of course. We do the same thing though so it's really pot calling kettle black.&gt; Did they not forcibly annex parts of their neighbors?Russia is doing this the old fashioned way. They don't like the modern American version, which is to install a puppet government.&gt; Is their leader not running an oppressive and corrupt government?He definitely is. There's no comparison to the US. US government doesn't have a corrupt core. Unlike Russia, where Putin is at the center of corruption, the US government corruption is decentralized. There isn't any one person that you can just bribe to collapse it all.&gt; Did Russia help elect TrumpI refuse to believe that Russia has spent $0.00 on any US political candidate no matter the election. Of course they spent money. [Just like we spend money on Russian political candidates to oust people we don't like.](https://www.sott.net/article/290848-Meet-Alexei-Navalny-The-US-State-Departments-inside-man-for-regime-change-in-Russia)Saying that “we do X, so we have no right to complain when Russia does it to us” is a fallacySaying X is awful because they do Y while you also do Y means you're also doing something awful. But you don't see it that way because you're not X.All of that is true, but I'm not really sure what US bombers on 24 hour alert will do about any of it. Creating a Cold War with an enemy that can’t realistically threaten us without being immediately annihilated (NK), while simultaneously ignoring the enemy that is currently in the process of destabilizing our government and those of our allies, with whom we had the last one. Yep. Only Trump. All other parties involved are insignificant.&gt;where there wasn't oneYes we never knew or heard anything about North Korea until Trump took office. He sat in that chair and BAM, KJI started testing nukes.Who says there's no such thing as a time machine? A succession of failed leadership has taken us back to the 80's... If it keeps going, we'll be facing a crisis not seen since the 1960's. We were just one bad decision away from ending civilization as we know it. And Trump isn't the person I want in charge if that moment comes around again.So I’m thinking we send the old Prez back to Dealey Plaza circa 1963.  Boy I'm sure glad we don't have a warmonger like Hillary Clinton in the White House /sWhat happened to ‘HILLARY IS GOING TO START WW3!’?Notice the hypocrites all have their fucking mouths shut now, with some even cheering this crap on.&gt;someNot some.  Most.Hillary Clinton was going to impose an illegal no fly zone over Syria. Which would have entailed shooting down Russian planes. Here OTOH, Russia had already been flying bombers to NATO borders. Not sure if you're being serious here but this is a clear misunderstanding on what a no fly zone is between world powers. With weak countries you can create them unilaterally if you're willing to shoot them down or where threats are enough. With strong ones, like Russia, you do it diplomatically.  Either through promises of sanction relief, or threat of further sanctions. No one is or was planning on unilaterally creating a no fly zone, then indiscriminately shooting down everything in it. You know, I grew up with this shit.  Nuclear attack drills where they made you hide under your desk (as though that would really help), videos in class of bombs going off and other crap like that.  We sure as hell don't need it all over again.&gt; Nuclear attack drills where they made you hide under your deskAKA bend over and kiss your ass goodbye drills.Let's all move from the the cities out to rural america.  They won't bomb us there, and then our vote will finally count.First word in the article: "if"Boy oh boy do I hate Trump.  This seems like overly expensive, unnecessary penis posturing. /r/justtrumpthingsfuck this dumb ass presidential dick measuring contest putting the world at riskHey remember when everyone was screaming how Hillary would be a warmonger? I do!Projection, just like everything else they complained about. I'm waiting for the news about Trump having a secret paedophile ring in the basement of a restaurant any day now. America - the big dimwitted kid at school who has an unhealthy obsession with weapons.Trump is making damn sure he the greatest... at being the worst President EVER!and there it starts. Trump won't be happy until he drops a nuclear bomb somewhere. You do realize our land based icbms are always on 24 hour alert right? At any time there's always crews in the bunkers ready to turn the key. This is a pretty pointless move considering we have the silos, but we've been prepared for war at a minute's notice since long before the soviets fell. As it is the bombers have just been sitting around gathering dust. We could have either scrapped them or put them back to use. The president chose option B Why spend trillions on a nuclear arsenal if you're not going to use it, right?What a fucking waste of resources. “Peace the old fashioned way”The only real use for this readiness is in deterrence.  Any actual nuclear warfare would be counterproductive (to say the least)Having the 24/7 nuclear airborn umbrella only made sense when we had out nuclear equal - the USSR to worry about. North Korea, if they could send a nuke to detonate in the US (and there are serious doubts), would not be capable of the sustained, devastating first strike the USSR was - and Putin's Russia still has. If Korea nuked the US, I'm confidant the US has all the nuclear capability required already in the area to do whatever needs doing to North Korea. This seems more like Trump casting a threat to Putin - perhaps warning him not to release compromat on him.Well, the *terrorists* angle didn't play out enough to our liking... so we're re-starting the cold war, to reap more fear to feed to our demons.I'm not too worried. I have all of the achievements for fallout 4. I'm pretty much ready if nuclear war happens.Bombers?  Did we run out of subs and ICBMs?Bombers are part of the Nuclear Triad.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_triadyes, I understand that, they also seem the least reliable, and require the most prep time, not being nearby like a sub, or fast like an icbm. Just being grumpy because the end of the world shouldn't look this ridiculous. Bombers can be recalled/redirected after launch, ICBM's cannot. Plus stealth bombers have the best first-strike capability. You won't know they are around until the bomb-bay doors open.Stealth bombers also provide a powerful second strike capability , even if all the ICBM silos are destroyed , bombers in the air are much harder to attack and they be used for a second wave of attacks or a as a second chance to attack if the missiles that were going to be the first strike are destroyed on the ground.It'd primarily be B-52s though wouldn't it?  There's only 20 B-2s and I don't think those are the ones that are being put on ready alert.edit: also B-2s only carry nuclear bombs, B-61 which has no propulsion.  Only the B-52 can carry the nuclear cruise missilehttp://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-americas-b-2-stealth-bomber-now-1000-times-more-ready-19560&gt; Only the B-52 can carry the nuclear cruise missileYep. Per SALT treaty, only the BUFF carries nuclear cruise missiles, and the B-1's aren't nuclear capable per agreement. But bombers are the sexiest. That's why he's doing it. Because he's functionally retarded. It would take about  30 minutes to reach the US west coast so it is plenty of time to take off. Plus they can carry up to 20 nuclear tipped cruise missiles that can be fired out side of enemy air space so they are more reliable than you think. Starting the 24-hour alerts again, however, does seem a bit much much in response to North Korea.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-69_SRAMThis is the missiles they carry.NK can't reach Hawaii, let alone the mainland. Don't provoke Russia and China trying to show NK (and your base) that you're a big tough guy i mean ffs. http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/28/540008218/north-korea-h-ballistic-missile-seoul-and-the-pentagon-sayThey can hit the mainland.Which Trump had no clue about during the debate.It’s a wrestling trio, right?Can't blame him for not knowing.  Trump had no idea what the nuclear triad was when asked about it during the GOP primary debates.I’ll bet he made fun of a Trump for not knowing what the Triad was during the debates. I would assume there is some sort of first strike (as terrifying as that is) operational advantage that it is hard/impossible to detect whether nukes are on the way or not via plane. Launch of an ICBM is detected worldwide very quickly.well the problem to me is Russia and China probably find the bombers being readied more threatening than NK does, and B-52's are very detectable by radar. Total arsenal brinksmanship with a country that can only hit SK and Japan seems a bit ridiculous, so the only reason to be ready for literally every warhead to be in the air is if you're also expecting Russia or maybe China to join the party and the end of the world makes me grumpyAlso a good practice to guarantee a second strike, a first strike against you will likely knock out a lot of our ground based deterrent. 
I’m frankly amazed that Dubai has such thriving tourism from “the West”. Stories like this one are exactly why it’s so low on my list of places I’d like to visit.The story that cemented my resolve to never visit Dubai:&gt;  [Briton jailed for four years in Dubai after customs find cannabis weighing less than a grain of sugar under his shoe](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-512815/Briton-jailed-years-Dubai-customs-cannabis-weighing-grain-sugar-shoe.html)Same thing happened to Grooverider, I thought this was the story about him. He flew there to play a gig and customs found 0.00X of a gram in his record flight case or something.From the article linked by BBQsauce "One man has even been jailed for possession of three poppy seeds left over from a bread roll he ate at Heathrow Airport."  Holy crap.Yes, visiting Islamic republics is down my travel list somewhere near North Korea and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Wait what's wrong with the Congo?Mostly just Malaria and Ebola.And fear of militias, crime, or general genocide.bad gorillas.can you say that in sign language?&gt;Wait what's wrong with the Congo?it's in Africa for starters I'd visit NK before I would ever go to SA or the middle east/congo.Better scenery for a start.Seen one fucking sand dune, you've seen 'em all really.&gt;visiting Islamic ~~republics~~slave statesDRC looks amazing, though. It is a massive country and only some of it is dangerous.Are the gorillas friendly at least?I've been offered a couple jobs over there and turned them down immediately, despite almost doubling my salary. I've been twice for conferences and tourism and that place SUCKS. It is one giant shopping mall filled with hypocritical assholes that impose archaic rules on everyone else knowing that they can get away with flaunting them. The faster that place collapses back into the desert the better. $$$ and prostitutes (western ones of course).I've been to Dubai probably 20 or so times and I've never understood why someone wants to vacation there. Sure parts (not all by a long shot) of it look nice, but the culture is very different. I felt more welcome in Kuwait than Dubai. Reminder: literally the only reason he was acquitted was because he was giving the UAE extremely bad PR. If he had been from some poor Asian or African country, he'd be in prison and for a lot longer than 3 months lol. If an Emirati wants you in prison, you WILL go to prison. Also if an Emirati committed a heinous crime against  foreigner, he would serve the minimal amount of time or none at all thanks to "wasta" (connections). I'm just gonna repost from the other thread, I know a lot of people will be extremely butthurt and upset that they're seeing this enormous post again but I want people to know the dark side of Dubai. I lived in the sandpit for just under a year and most people have no idea how bad it is, and I want more people to know what the less fortunate experience there. What the migrant women experience there is what real oppression and real "rape culture" look like. The things that the locals get away with there are beyond your imagination: 4 Emirati men kidnapped an Ethiopian maid, gang-raped her twice in different locations, then ran her over with a car and then proceeded to stone her to death with large rocks which smashed her skull into pieces. After paying 200k dirhams ($50k) "blood money" in total (so around $12.5k each, a few months salary for an Emirati), they were released from prison. One of the attackers 13 years prior had raped and murdered a Pakistani little girl, but her father who was an imam forgave him.So just to be clear, 4 Emirati men, one of whom was already a known rapist and murderer, gang raped and then brutally murdered an Ethiopian housemaid, smashing her skull into pieces, and they were released after paying just over $10k each. Because in the UAE foreign victims are practically forced into accepting blood money by their lawyers (always Emirati), none of them received their sentence. This was the "Al Dhaid murder", I strongly insist people look it up because it's even worse than you think. Search "Al Dhaid murder" on google for a proper set of results on how serious it was, it's even more grotesque than you think. So basically, this disgusting crime is not as bad as just normal consensual sex because as we know, Emiratis can do no wrong.Here's a story of how a French 15 year old teenage boy "Alex" was gang-raped by 3 Emirati men and it turns out that they gave him HIV/AIDS. Anyway, before outcry from human rights groups, it was he, rather than the rapists, that was arrested and blamed. The boy was actually quite lucky his mother was well connected with the diplomatic circles otherwise like the vast majority of other cases he would have been jailed for being raped.http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/world/middleeast/01dubai.htmlA doctor examined Alex the night of the rape, taking swabs of DNA for traces of the rapists’ sperm. He did not take blood tests or examine Alex with a speculum. Then he cleared the room and told Alex: “I know you’re a homosexual. You can admit it to me. I can tell.” Alex told his father in tears: “I’ve just been raped by three men, and he’s saying I’m a homosexual,” according to interviews with both of them. The doctor, an Egyptian, wrote in his legal report that he had found no evidence of forced penetration, which Alex’s family says is a false assessment that could hurt the case against the assailants.In early September, after the family learned about the older attacker’s H.I.V. status and the French government lodged complaints with the United Arab Emirates authorities, the Dubai attorney general’s office assigned a new prosecutor to the case. Only then were forensic tests performed to confirm that sperm from all three attackers had been found in Alex.Alex stayed in Dubai in order to testify against his attackers, and went back to school in September, despite suffering unsettling flashbacks. In early October, however, the family said, their lawyer warned Alex that he was in danger of facing charges of homosexuality and a prison term of one year.http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/world/middleeast/01dubai.htmlThere was another case involving a French girl where an Emirati singer, Saoud Abou Sultan, lured the girl to his room, spiked her drink and gang-raped her with others while she was unconscious. She woke up in the middle of the desert found by a police officer and apparently she had bruises all over her stomach and private parts. Anyway the most shocking thing about this was that Saoud Abou Sultan, being an Emirati, was not convincted of rape but for "consensual sex". He did receive 6 months of jail time which is impressive for a local who usually get nothing, but it was only because of "consensual sex" not rape. How the fuck is spiking a girl's drink, gang-raping her and dumping her in the desert consensual"? Is that worth 6 months in jail?Rape victims, usually maids, are arrested for "seduction" or "extramarital sex" in the UAE while the rapist Emiratis have impunity: https://news.vice.com/article/rape-victims-are-being-jailed-under-extramarital-sex-laws-in-the-uae One BBC article apparently showed a rape victim being chained up after revealing her rape: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/hundreds-of-women-prosecuted-for-extramarital-sex-in-uae-finds-bbc Apparently one Ethiopian servant who was raped was arrested and when they found she was pregnant, chained her to the hospital bed to prevent her from absconding from her crime of being raped.Another recent story in the UAE where an Emirati woman gruesomely tortured an Indonesian maid for months and then starved her to death. The police recovered her starved, battered and bruised body with torture marks everywhere and found blood stains all over the house. They then realized the Emirati woman had been torturing and starving maids for a decade but they did not punish her or even arrest her, because the maids did not end up dead. Only when the Emirati finally managed to starve a maid to death did the Emirati police bother arresting her. There was a similar case which happened slightly before, where an Emirati tortured an African woman to death after months of abuse. Neighbours siad they heard screams and wails for months through the walls. Read it: http://www.emirates247.com/crime/local/woman-starves-maid-to-death-dubai-court-told-2016-02-26-1.622369Another case of what Emiratis are allowed to do with impunity:https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/24/the-vanished-filipino-domestic-workers-working-abroad“My employer was like a lion with no mercy,” she says. Marina says she was forced to work 22 hours a day without rest. She woke at 4am to start cleaning the family’s fleet of cars and worked through to 2am the following morning. “I had no time off, no time to rest ever. Even when I was trying to eat, she would be calling me: ‘You are not here to rest. I paid a lot of money for you.’ To her, I was a slave. I was not a human.”After a month of working constantly on two hours sleep and little food, Marina’s health was deteriorating fast. She lost sensation in the right half of her body and couldn’t use her hands. “I was so tired it felt like I couldn’t control my brain. After a few weeks I was in so much pain, I couldn’t walk or lift anything. I didn’t know if my children were OK. I felt so alone.”Yet her female Emirati employer told her, ‘You can’t go back to the Philippines because I paid money for you,’” Marina says. She claims her employer threatened to get her sent to jail, or kill her, and screamed that she would dump her in the desert. “She told me, ‘If I killed you, nobody would care and nobody would find you.’ I said, ‘Madam, if you want to kill me, go ahead.’” After this, Marina says, her boss tried to poison her. The husband of the house then threatened to beat her with a baton, and locked her in a prayer room for three days and nights with no food or water.“I would just say to anyone who is thinking of going to work abroad, don’t trust anyone,” she says. “They will kill you and nobody will do anything to help.”https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/24/the-vanished-filipino-domestic-workers-working-abroadIn short what I am trying to say is that if you are not an Emirati, you are a subhuman slave to them, a beast of burden. The Gulf states are truly the most racist and dehumanizing places on earth for non-locals. Anyone who has lived in the Arab world for more than a few months knows full well that many of them genuinely and sincerely do not view migrant workers from Asia/Africa as fully human and treat them as animals. E.g. http://www.99media.org/slavery-in-the-arab-world/ "The host, the mother of my acquaintance, reeled around laughing. "This is not a human being, she [her maid] is an animal and will be treated as such" Sometimes the level of prejudice is actually quite amusing because it's so farcical. For instance (and if you don't believe me on this, ask anyone who has lived in the Gulf), the way the police figure out who is responsible for a crime is not based on evidence but based on nationality. So for instance, if an Emirati man crashes into the car of an expat or migrant worker etc, that would be the fault of the expat because he's not Emirati and the former would be arrested.Always remember these incidents before you go to Dubai. Or just don't go at all. Don't give these kinds of people your money. Make sure people know things like this happen.Fuck dubaiI'm an air traffic controller in the UK and have been offered jobs in both Qatar and the UAE. Instead of jumping at the chance to earn more than double what I'm currently on, I spent several days researching and reaching out to colleagues who worked in both countries. Ultimately I did not even respond to their emails asking me to come to interview. I did not feel risking my family's safety was worth the amount they would pay me. Plus when you consider workers rights do not exist for anyone except Emiratis/Qataris in their respective country, it was a very easy option.There's a reason they will pay you such a huge amount of money. Even as a white British male, I would be sneered at by the locals and treated poorly. It's simply not worth it.Would you really need to take your family out there? I would've liked to, yes, as would they. We spent several days discussing all of it and came to the conclusion if I did go, they'd come with me.That's a good call you made there. The moral of the story is: If for some reason you and your buddies are vacationing in a shithole, document everything to Reddit.  If one of you gets arrested for being gay, get the story to go viral and just wait for the government to save face.Lol don’t worry, there will be another one in a couple to few months. “Welcome to Dubai:  Beautiful Modern Architecture with all the 3rd World Shitty Culture You Crave!”great outcome.  this mess has been terrible P.R. for the Emirates... it should never have gotten this badThey deserve all of the negative PR they receive. Jesus, I wouldn’t last five minutes over there. “Touched another man’s hip?”. I will spank you if you’re between me and the counter. Really? Where do you shop? Just out of curiosity.Not in the shop, in pubs. Don’t Iceland have an ad where Kerry Katona slaps her ass though? Could be connected. My knowledge of Iceland ends at Snorri Sturluson."Snorri Sturluson was an Icelandic historian, poet, and politician."Not at all what I was expecting, pleasantly surprised.Fuck Dubai. Why would anyone go there for "fun" if fun is illegal? That place sounds fucking awful.If you have enough money, even stuff that's illegal in the west, is pretty easy to find and partake in.  Also, the Instagram posts. Been to Dubai once.  Plane landed, 15 minutes later I'm being interrogated and strip searched.   Terrified, embarrassed, violated and verbally attacked and threatened.  Then after a half hour or more they stop, shove my suitcases at me and say "Welcome to Dubai!"Welcome to Dubai????? I hated every moment I spent in that sandy shit hole full of rich, arrogant pricks. The only nice people I met were other foreigners.  Money and sand and virtual slaves everywhere. Since my experiences there, I make sure every time I wander into a conversation about Dubai that I tell people what a horrible place it is, and to not go there. Just doing my part in helping Dubai slip back under the sand. I'm glad Scot is okay and that he's cool with being on a first-name basis.Perhaps this is where the term “Scot free” comes from.http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/04/scot-free-origin/Hold on, I read the Arabic article regarding the British man's arrest. He didn't simply "touch another man". He groped the German man, held onto his ass, and then gave him the middle finger when he was pushed off. The German man filed a police report against the British man which lead to his arrest.He didn't simply "touch another man".Really?!  I don't know which story to believe.  German man is also an ass for calling the cops knowing what would happen in Dubai.So I've read three articles in Arabic that were all published days before any English articles were published, all three mentioned the exact same details I described in my comments. These details were obtained from the official report and from court transcripts later on.I don't know where the English articles received their information from, or why the authors would want to make it seem like the British man simply "touched another man's hip". I choose to believe the Arabic articles simply because they actually reference their source, also because I don't think the English authors did their own investigation of the story.
&gt; The mother of one young female student at the party said it was a gathering for the school’s dance team. She said she didn’t want to be identified because she’s a Miami-Dade County school teacher.Way to go! There is no way anyone can narrow down who this woman or her child is, you know.. because we said she isn't being identified. Look, everyone on the dance team has a mom who works as a teacher for Miami-Dade. /sNot the math teacher I hope. Considering pretty much 90% of female teachers are also mothers, how likely do you think it is?Edit: the mother went on camera, her wish to remain anonymous was from the public at large, not parents on the dance team.  I didn't think this was that hard to understandThings stated in this short sentence.1) Child is at the party.  2) Party is for the dance group only.  3) Child is a girl  4) Child's mother is a teacher.So, how many of the female dance party members there has the mom who is a teacher? Ohhh, Susie's mom..yep, must be.Reading comprehension is so hard.Considering it was being thrown for a former student, so there could be other former team members, we don't know how many people were there, whether people not on the dance team (friends of team members) attended, or how many of the students had parents that worked for the district, you and I have no idea how likely it is to easily identify the parent.  Regardless, her reasoning seemed to be so the public couldn't identify her, since she had no problem speaking on camera, which I'm guessing would be a much easier method of identifying her.  Apparently critical thinking is hard.you must have worked on the JFK investigation...either that or you're the detective they put in shows like Sherlock and Murder She Wrote so that the audience doesn't feel like an idiot when then the real plot is exposed by the protagonist. Yeah, so the fact that the woman was on film, meaning it would be easy for any coworkers or parents close to her would be able to identify her, holds no weight?  I've worked in the public sector for a decade, and anyone who doesn't want to be identified is due to not wanting the public to know who they areConsidering you pulled that statistic straight out of your ass? More likely than you being right.It wasn't meant to be scientific.  My point was that it's not any guarantee that the teacher will be outed just because we now know she's a teacher.  There, did I use enough small words?You believe that a ridiculously high percentage of teachers are also mothers, otherwise you wouldn't have posted it. Don't get all snippy cus i called you out.Okay, since your claim is just as unfounded, I don't even see your point.  What is the percentage, since you seem to know that 90% is "ridiculously high?"You pulled numerical statistics out of your ass to support your opinion  that 9 out of 10 female teachers are mothers and you can't see my point?No, I see your point.  Your point is that you know that statistic is wrong based on...based on what exactly?  Even still, the fact that you think my entire argument was based specifically on the 90% figure is baffling to me.  My point was that a large majority of female teachers and employees of the school system in general have children.  I know exactly one female in my own workplace who doesn't have a child out of about 20.  So since you told me my statistic is pulled out of my ass, please, refute it with your own scientific research.As for my own, it seems I was off, [by about 7 percentage points](http://www.oecd.org/els/family/SF_2-5-Childlessness.pdf).  Now, that doesn't specifically reference teachers, but since you know yourself, I'm eager for your datayou use so many logical fallacies that it's not even worth their time to reply to you. You use annecdotal information, personal bias, arbitrarty statistics that "prove" you were right when it turns out your guess wasn't far off, you have false connections between things, and you're rude lol. Thank god for the fucking ignore button, you are seriously just a waste of time. No problem :)Though I didn't realize personal bias was anywhere in my comment...anyway, like I said earlier, my 90% statistic wasn't even supposed to be exactThe article leaves out a very important point....who brought the dicks?   #whobroughtthedickshttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1-FtB-SmLTIStart video at 8:10It was Ming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG9COlGgZl4&gt; her daughter is extremely upset. “She couldn’t sleep last night. She woke up crying,” said the mother. “It hurts that she’s being taught this at the school where I trust she’s gonna be taken care of.”Yea... sure... I will totally believe that mom.If the daughter knows nothing about the things she saw, why would they be upsetting to the point of her not being able to sleep?At that age, I was more likely to lose sleep over fear of getting grounded or having my controller or game taken away for something I didn't even do wrong.You'd lose sleep if your mom publicly busted your naughty business too.Yeah, you tell that young girl what she should and shouldn't be concerned about!Edit: I've seen two upvoted comments in this thread with opposite explanations why this young girl shouldn't be upset. We have this one which says because she doesn't know about penises yet (lol), she shouldn't care cause video games are the real concern at that age. Then there's the other that claims because the Redditor was already masturbating at age 11, this girl *should* know all about this stuff and that means it shouldn't be a big deal. Fuckig weirdos in this thread. I promise you that girl didn't cry herself to sleep because she saw a penis hatSpencer's Gifts is responsible for traumatizing thousands of kids walking around shopping malls. It wasn't just the penis hat. There was more than that and on top of it at all, it was done by a teacher at the actual school. Context matters a lot here. But hey, I'm glad you can speak for the girl and the mom. Pretty impressive you know exactly how she felt after this. Oh yeah a vagina cake! When I read the headline I was expecting drug fueled orgy. Not a fucking bridal shower  Lmao, what bridal shower has ever had any of those things? What you're looking for is bachelorette party and there's no way you can say those are appropriate for younger people, unless it's for a Mormon wedding. No one's saying that the party was appropriate, just that the idea that a teenage girl can't sleep at night because she saw some novelty penis and vagina party favors is absurd.No those would be much much worse Well you can have my upvote. Reddit is a bunch of socially maladjusted losers trying to pass themselves off as presentable intellectuals, of course this is the reaction you get."My 5 year old just came in and said 'Daddy, why is it so easy for mentally disturbed individuals to buy automatic weapons in the US with no background checks? I thought about it for a long time and said 'I don't know son... I don't know.'"Did everyone clap at the end?Only after he pleadedYesterday, after reading the news, my daughter asked me a question. “Mom, is it true that there are biological reasons why there are fewer women in tech and leadership?”- Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YoutubeWow, I hadn't even seen that one. I had to look it up.*I thought about all of this, looked at my daughter and answered simply.**“No, it’s not true.”*/r/wokekids Huh? You have to pass a background check for a .22 break action long rifle.You have to do much much more to be able to get an automatic firearm. I know, it was more a joke about parents pretending to quote their kids on complicated issues. It seems to be a trend right now. Wow, that went straight over my head. Good timesYou can buy a .22 break action long rifle from a private dealer or gun show without a background check. Furthermore, federally regulated dealers who are required to do background checks do not have to verify with any other state. So, yes, it is obscenely easy. It's a different argument to discuss how instituting those things would be a burden on small businesses/private owners, but let's not just willfully ignore how easy it is to buy guns in this country.Every fire arms dealer I have had dealings with at a gun show run a back ground check.  Every single one.  When I hear people say that gun shows are somehow a loop hole  I cringe.  The dealer doesn't want the legal repercussion of selling to someone who would put their business at risk for further Federal scrutiny.  However - private sales are unregulated.  Gun purchasing is easy if you aren't a criminal; even so, if you are a criminal - you just use other means.    Tell someone with the last name Smith, Jones, or Brown how obscenely easy it is....they will be waiting forever on the background check.  The "Gun Show Loophole" got its name because there were an increasing number of private sellers that sold alongside federally regulated dealers. This is still the case. I agree the vast majority of dealers at gun shows are federally regulated, but the labeling is still useful because it demonstrates the fact that there is, indeed, a loophole. Private resellers can sell their guns to whomever without a background check, and they can set up shop wherever. In reality, the loophole pertains more to the who than the where, but it is still ridiculous.&gt;but the labeling is still useful because it demonstrates the fact that there is, indeed, a loophole.Let's stroll down memory lane, kids...In 1993, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was passed into law. The overarching purpose was to mandate background checks on firearms purchases. The GOP successfully negotiated to remove private sales from the purview of this law, arguing that it was a pointless waste of time to require a background check for a father to sell his son a firearm, and so on. The Democrats ultimately agreed, and the act passed with bipartisan support in both Houses. And ever since then, Democrats have screeched about a "loophole" that they agreed to in the first place. Slippery slopes and all that.It's not a "loophole" though. It's just private citizens selling their property to people. It happens way more often *not* at gunshows than at gunshows. Democrats agreed to allowing private transactions when background checks were first being implemented. It was a compromise.tbh i am against private transactions on gun sales without background checks. I am a bit surprised gun stores haven't pushed for licenses to sell guns period, that way they can get a monopoly on sales and force all second hand sales to go through them.  Liqueur is one industry where stores often keep competition out of the market through regulations.There's no such thing as a "private dealer" of firearms. There's ordinary people who sell their guns to friends and family members and occasionally strangers they meet at a gunshow or on the Internet. If you're "engaged in the buisness of selling firearms" without an FFL, then you're breaking federal law. You can buy guns and sell them, but you cannot buy guns specifically to sell. Because 100 year old firearms technology that are inanimate objects kill less people every year than hammers and baseball bats. Not if you are mentally together enough to get yourself to a gun show.The correct answer is "Because if you don't let them buy automatic weapons they'll throw a temper tantrum. Now do whatever the nice crazy man with the machine gun tells you."[removed]She couldn't sleep because she woke up crying? [removed]You're a tucking idiot. "Couldn't sleep" doesn't mean logged 0 seconds of sleep, it's obvious the phrase means can't sleep restfully [removed]And yeah I do think I'm smarter than you based solely on this interaction [removed]Hilarious man Or language isn't completely literal...[removed]I never said that, just "couldn't sleep" doesn't mean had zero sleep. If I sleep for half an hour one night I'll still report to family and friends that I "couldn't sleep." Have you ever had an actual conversation before?[removed]https://youtu.be/RybNI0KB1bgParties don’t have ratings. They do if you do them right ;)Not many people know about the Miami Party Advisory Association, the "other MPAA."Except this one. It was rated 'X' for 'X-ellent!!!'Legally they do in Miami, and that rating must be XBoner HatReading the comments to this article it seems most people think it's perfectly reasonable for a teacher to have a bachelorette party in a classroom where she teaches.  My mind's a little bit boggled.  She was fired, and completely deserved it.  She? Bachelorette? Are those things in the video? They're not in the written article that I can see. The teacher's sex isn't specified and the party appears to have been for a boy. I concur. Change the story and make the teacher a male and see how the sentiment would change. Charges of sexual harassment and other things would be flying through the air. Now that's not what happened but sexuality is something we should be careful of on school grounds...and around 11 year olds I would think. It’s because most people on reddit are teenagers or in their early 20s and would like this type of behavior to be perfectly ok. Why are there 11 year olds at an after school party for a student who already graduated high school?X-rated party in the title's context really had me thinking this was going in another direction. Seems like the sanctimonious right building themselves into a froth.I've dated a few teachers in Miami. They're fuuuucked up. I'd recommend, not as teachers though.Once I saw Miami, I wondered what the issue was.  Isn't motto: Here be Porno... happened in front of children as young as eleven... Dafuq did she think would happen? People flip out of two people of the same gender hold hands in front of their "innocent little angel". Much less a lewd batchelorett type party...While the party was inappropriate for eleven year olds i think if we taught better sex ed in our schools this country would loosen its grip a bit on its collective pearls.I get what you're saying. The response would've been less extreme if it wasn't seen as that frightening. And I can say there are teachers who have done things that are far worse, during school hours, who haven't been fired.No, we would still have people that want to complain. Definitely. But, I do agree sex ed needs reform. We don't teach it at all. We tell kids what happens during puberty but then tell them sex is evil. You WILL get pregnant. You WILL get an STI. We try to fear monger kids away from sex and then expect them to figure it out on their own once adults. Sure seems to be working. /sOh I agree that sex Ed needs to be reformed, because it doesn't even exist where I live. We have a massive problem with teenage pregnancy because of it. Problem is I live in a major religious state, and when sex Ed is brought up... The Bible thumping shit storm goes to colossal porportions. Oh I get it. It's so insane how afraid people are of something so natural. All because people don't want to admit to themselves that little Timmy and Sue are gonna grow up and fuck others like rabbits, just like their parents did. All their closed minded BS accomplishes is insuring diseases and teen pregnancies live on. Not to mention all the depression young girls and boys feel when their hormones are running wild and they feel like they're being a slut or going to end up burning for eternity because nature is screaming "go fuck someone!" In their head non-stop.[Teen pregnancy rates are at all-time lows.] (https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/index.htm)http://nypost.com/2017/06/06/texas-sees-high-rate-of-teen-births-despite-abstinence-only-sex-ed/You are probably right.Yea, let's make sure all the 11 year old girls know that when Harvey Weinstein wants to jerk off in front of them in order to get the part, it's tote norms.Let's also make sure we tell students to go into psycotherapy to deal with the droves of young adults trying to deal with the negative mental consequences of casual sex as they venture into adulthood.wow you are all kinds of fucked up. Listen here buddy teens are gonna have sex whether you helicopter parent or not. Least we can do is teach them to be safe, but thats too much for you isnt it? I never said what the teach did was appropriate, thats you setting up strawmen.Penis hats lead to psychotherapy, obvsI haven't been to Florida, but keep in mind that girls that age can get legally married there, with the consent of a judge. Its been in the news lately that *Afghanistan* has tougher child-marriage laws than Florida. Maybe there's something in the water.That's a serious lapse in judgement.I'm confused. The article says that this party took place in the classroom after school had ended and was for a former students but then it also says parents were outraged this would be done in class. Which is it?I don't have a problem with a teacher throwing a former student an apparent bachelorette party with dick shaped everything, but having it at a classroom seems like a really stupid idea. Why the hell not move it off school grounds?with 11 year olds? Yeah no reason why it should have been on school grounds unless it was because the kids were so young in order to avoid charges of inappropriate behavior...which means it was wrongNothing in this article makes sense.Hosting a party, 👍in your classroom, 👎for a former student, 👍with current students, 👎who are minors, 👎themed around sexually explicit paraphernalia. 👍What a bad idea...&gt;throwing an X-rated surprise party for **a former student.**&gt;the party happened in the dance teacher’s classroom **after school** Wednesday.whole lotta noise over nothing. &gt;her daughter is extremely upset. “She couldn’t sleep last night. She woke up crying,” said the motherand this is just bullshit or you raised your daughter wrong. &gt; The party happened in front of students as young as 11 years old.I think it's perfectly reasonable to fire a teacher who is organizing parties with penis hats and vagina cakes and inviting 11 year old students.I like that the person you responded to uses the fact that the party took place in the classroom as a reason why it's not bad.Did you read their comment? While I agree the GP post is a fallacious, they are highlighting the after school portion not the classroom Ah you're right about that. Kinda spaced on what was bolded there. Either way, it took place at school and I'm kind of baffled by so many in thread trying so hard to explain why it's a big deal and nobody should be upset by it. You're fine, sorry for a bit of a snarky response. Been bored at the airport reading too much reddit. Have come across some deplorable comments/people which has put me into a little bit of a bad mood lmao What age would you say is appropriate? Only half jokingI guess 18 and out of high school.Maybe.  I sure as shit wouldn't want to be crucified as a pederast if I was teaching a health class to middle schoolers and decided to lighten things up a bit with penis hats.That's nowhere near what happened though... She was a dance teacher, and this was a party.At school? NeverTeacher shouldn't be having a bawdy party on school grounds. Also, a former student doesn't mean that the student is an adult.What point are you trying to make? Defending the teacher? Bashing the mom? Maybe I missed something in the article but why are these comments so hateful towards the mother? All she did was express concern?The mom is clearly full of shit.How's it clear? Because she is hispanic and a woman. moms who dont want daughters seeing penis pops at school = full of shit.  what the fuck is wrong with you? While i think everyone agrees it was inappropriate, i say this with the greatest amount of annoyance possible "Get over yourself mom, your kids are saying/doing just as worse among their friends." Also god forbid we teach our children sex ed and being responsible in this country, lest we have teen mothers. OMG BECKY SAW A PENIS, SHE IS SCARRED FOR LYFE!@!@!!!@22Difference between sex education and this fuck-up teacher giving vagina lollipops to preteens.Like i said, it was inappropriate and deserving of a firing... Whats your point?This wasn't teaching sex ed, did you read the article? Jesus this comment thread is retarded. [deleted]This is a teacher. They are trusted with kids physical and emotional safety. Teaching sex Ed is totally necessary, but again this was a sleazy fucking weird ass faux-bachelorette party. Yeah it's not the worst thing in the world to lay eyes on, but in that context I could totally see an 11 year old being justifiably rattled over it. [deleted]Who the fuck cares when YOU started jerking off? Lotta weirdos in this thread holy fuck. [deleted]Are you saying that a grown man giving a surprise pornography themed party to 11 year old girls and boys should be considered appropriate because they're expected to know how sex works by that age?That's quite the assumption. Not every 11 year old is sexually cognizant. The fact you personally tugged your rotten pecker at that age doesn't mean a totally unrelated girl needs to be fine with a teacher shoving a ton of genital stuff in their faces. Christ you guys are fucking creepy. Jesus Christ you are one dense motherfucker.Nah I think there's just a lot of creeps in here Just because kids might joke around or see this stuff with their friends doesn't mean it's the same thing when the adult teacher inserts themselves into it.You sound like a complete creep.At no point in any of my comments did i say it was appropriate for a teacher to engage in this kind of behavior, in fact i was said it was inappropriate and they deserved to be fired. Did you just see the parts where i was saying the mother is acting like her kids scarred for life because she saw some phallic shaped candy and completely ignored the rest?When you've got Teen Vogue printing Anal Sex How tos and teachers thinking it is ok to decorate a classroom with penis pops, parents have every right to be concerned.Just because you are ok with your child thinking becoming a sexualized set of holes is normal, doesnt mean that other parents also negligent degenerates.Yeah thats not something im gonna look up to prove you wrong. You are projecting an awful lot man. The teen vogue anal sex how to article is a real thing. The magazine has gone from makeup and flirting to having writers write anti trump opinion pieces and anal sex how tos in it. I saw it on /r/wtf like 2 months ago and opened a copy next time I was at the magazine area at my grocery store and it was there. username checks out.https://www.teenvogue.com/story/anal-sex-what-you-need-to-know&gt;in the dance teacher’s classroom after school Wednesday.How did they think this was a good idea?  Hell, I've thought twice about letting myself into the building to use the bathroom after hours.You apparently forgot to read the part where the party was also in front of minors as young as eleven years old.This firing was completely justified. No one is upset that it was an adult-themed party. That's not the issue. The issue is that the party was done ON SCHOOL GROUNDS in front of people AS YOUNG AS ELEVEN YEARS OF AGE. CocaineFire is just a dumbass cherry picking info out of the story he skimmed over.  Nothing to see here.  I mean there were 11 year olds. Change the story in just one way. Make the teacher a Male.Still feel this was overblown? Where does it indicate the teacher's gender?Seriously....dick shaped lollipops aren’t a reason to cry unless you’re literally abusing your kid with the notion that sex is evil until you’re married. Parents trying to “protect” their kids are ridiculous when they get this overbearing. With that said it was probably inappropriate having a party with dick candy and pussypops on a school campus. Edit: alright I missed the part where there was an 11 year old present. Somebody should have had the sense to know that wasn’t ok (along with pretty much most everything that happened).there was an 11 year old present.  Please ask your degenerate teachers to keep your penis pops away from children.  How hard is it?  Pun intended.  Sick of this shit.  Next up Teen Vogue will be issuing How To Have Anal Sex..wait, that already happened.I missed the part about the 11 year old. Anyone should have the judgement to know that’s unacceptable. Still stand by the rest of what I said though. Again, not condoning what happened, but I still the mother is dramatizing the story quite a bit. That seems like grooming. Or the best health class EVERNo, I'm going with the grooming hypothesis. At 11? Yeah, probably.Hah, "I raised my daughter the proper way," like the kid isn't going to naturally develop sexual urges and interests. Some parents are so fucking stupid.Most of my class was past watching their first porn video at 10 yo.... at 14 most of us would crack sex jokes here and there.... I bet she's one of those parents that think their child doesn't know how incognito web browser works...lOf course this was in Florida I thought Miami had a law that all parties had to be X rated.This is the second "Florida teachers doing perverted shit" article on the front of r/news todayHeadline misleading . It leaves   out was that it for  a student and at schoolwhoa whoa whoa. how the fuck can something be "x-rated" when there is literally zero sex or nudity? I'm sorry, but having fake penises at a party is just good ol' fashioned fun, not "x-rated" or anything to get so upset about. jesus christ i hate conservative (I mean as in prude, not in the political sense) parents. they do no favors to their kids with over-protective and sensitive crap.Don't go in thereYou'll become oneFreaky creature'sMonster partyIt seems really confusing. The young pre-teens were traumatized by... Dildos? I'm not worried about the dildos or the Vagina cake. On their own they mean nothing. If a bunch of 12 year olds brought dildos to school as a prank for a funny birthday party that's one thing.The mother in this video should be more upset or afraid of the school teacher himself, since an adult who is OK with these activities in his classroom is the biggest threat to the children. Again, rubber penises on their own are harmless. However... an adult around kids with inappropriate sex toys is creepy, predatory behavior and really should involve the police, because where there's smoke there could be fire. [deleted]The story does not indicate the teacher's sex.The daughter is traumatized from rubber penis toys and hats? She woke up in the middle of the night with night terrors? Nothing even happened to her. She went to a party and left. Didn't get hurt, touched... abused... nothing.The new generations are getting more and more pathetic. Its disgusting. Shes weaker than normal and should either be put in a protective home that her parents can pay for because they caused the damage, or she should perhaps be culled. Because you know what... the world isn't going to suddenly turn all nice.You may not like the way I write out my opinion, but be rational for a moment. Isn't it kind of pathetic? What is going to happen to her when she goes outside and sees people yelling at one another? What happens when she does something stupid and gets yelled at? What happens when she sees her first bad word on a T-shirt? She already can't handle life. &gt;“You can’t even imagine,” said the mother. “You know, I’ve raised my daughter the proper way and never taught her anything similar to that.”Lady did you forget that you also grew up?  How are you this naive?But did she take all the students to a comedy club to ruin someone's set?Prissy, prissy, prissy.  Bound and determined to create another generation with the same sex hangups and dysfunction that they're living with in their own lives.  Er, fuck these people.Whole lotta noise over nothing.  Penis shaped hat?  Really?  That's X-rated?&gt;The party happened in front of students as young as **11 years old**.There were numerous other genital-themed decorations, and it was at *school*. This is not okay *at all*. I think the teacher should be fired just because she's dumb as a rock, if she thought this was a good idea. If you can't comprehend the consequences of doing this, you have no business teaching kids.But the hysteria of "omg, my little angel saw penis-shaped hat, now she's scarred for life!" is more damaging to kids than the penis-shaped hat itself.  Just explain that it's vulgar and poor taste, and move on.&gt;“In the videos, we see how they were preparing for the surprise party. And as the boy walked in, they surprised him with a hat that had a penis attached to the top and a string to be able to pull it so it can get erected,” said the mother.&gt;The party included rubber penises, penis candles, penis hats and more.&gt;“There was a cake that had a lollipop shaped as a vagina,” said the mother.So this is more than a kid saw something depicting a penis. This was a sexually-themed party for an older boyAnd later... &gt;She said her daughter is extremely upset. “She couldn’t sleep last night. She woke up crying,” said the mother.**It's not okay to force 11 year old children into sexual social situations they aren't prepared for.** Plenty of kids come from sheltered homes where they don't even watch R-rated movies. They don't belong at quasi-bachelorette parties. Ask their parents, at the *very* least. My thoughts exactly!  Party was definitely inappropriate for the ages of the kids involved, and teacher deserves being reprimanded if not fired.But god forbid your little angel finds out what body parts are responsible for their existence. /sBoo hoo. Yeah the teacher should get fired, but this is hardly some awful tragedy that deserved to be national news It's on a local news site....You're on an international news siteI don't think I ever implied otherwise, but yes I was awareWho said it was national news? I didn't even upvote the story, just commented. &gt; There were numerous other genital-themed decorations, and it was at school. This is not okay at all.UNLESS it was a health class. What the fucks wrong with American teachers. Why can't you keep your whore self in your private domain? Couldn't sleep last night, woke up CRYING?! Someone is putting on their best lawsuit statement.Haha. A high-school girl was terrorized by the sight of toy penises. "She couldn’t sleep last night. She woke up crying”.  An 11 year old is not a high school age child.  Her mother is either a sex-negative feminist or a traditional conservative wet blanket.  Both kinds of women are shit and deserve the death squad.   Holy shit, this is about penis- and vagina-shaped decorations.on school grounds .... with 11 year olds. Do you have kids?Didn't say it wasn't inappropriate, but the headline made it seem a lot more heinous and I was mildly relieved at the reality of the situation. And no, I do not have kids. Why does that matter? Everyone was once a kid, so we all have equally valid opinions about childhood. When you're 16: WHOOOOOOAAAA YAAAA LET'S PARTY AT THE TEACHERS HOUSEWhen you're 26: OMG THEY PARTIED AT THE TEACHERS HOUSE!! EVIL, UNHEARD OF!! FIRE HER!!!Voice of reason: But didn't you..Moronic voice we listen to in our head: BUT THAT WAS DIFFERENT!!Voice of reason: but.. you did.. the exact.. literally exact same thingMoronic voice in our head: SILENCE LIES IT WAS DIFFERENT!!!... we are an amusing species. 11 year old, that changes the story. Also, it was wrong because fucked up and inappropriate things happen at those parties. Just because you did something stupid when you were a kid doesn't make it less stupid as an adult. I mean if you were raped by a 21-year-old when you were 14 at a party do you tell your daughter "get over it, we were all young once"If I had a teacher do that when I was in junior high I might think it was bullshit but the adult in me today recognizes that was wrong. When you too grow up you might agree. There's really only one moronic voice here....
Most people who fuck disabled kids this hard get charged with child rape.  For Betsy DeVos, it’s just another Monday morningComparable to hiring someone that's blind to teach batting practice. This lady is completely out of her element. &gt;President Trump in February signed an executive order “to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens,” spurring Education Department officials to begin a top-to-bottom review of its regulations. The department sought comments on possible changes to the special education guidance and held a hearing, during which many disability rights groups and other education advocates pressed officials to keep all of the guidance documents in place, Jones said.Later in the article:&gt;“Notwithstanding the actions taken by the Department today, the regulations still remained enforced; however they lack the clarification the guidance provided.”So I guess my question is, what exactly are these guidance documents, how are they utilized, and is their any potential setbacks that could come about with them being rescinded? That's just Betsy DeVos' way of telling the disabled to pull themselves up by the bootstraps.  
A true hero. Need more people like him. Wow, amazing article. I am miffed it took so long to give this hero his medal.If the mission was secret he could have been given it, but had to wait for the mission to be declassified to actually have it. It was something like that with the Argo story. He got the highest civilian medal, but because it was a secret mission, he had to wait 60 years or something for it to be declassified.Yea. Dude says he didn’t even talk about it until he’d been out of the military for years. That man believed in OpSec.Why was it a secret mission to receive the Medal of Honor? Those are usually very public. I assume the large number of casualties are because they had to go through downtown DC. Can't wait to see how Trump finds a way to insult him. I like to imagine Trump if he was drafted as being like the fat guy who was in Charlie Sheen’s unit at the beginning of Platoon."I like heroes that don't keep their mouths shut for decades."Ooops - 44 missed one
All I know is when a single individual pays somebody $32,000,000.00 dollars to shut up ..you seriously did something wrong....lol but they can say he didn't do anything wrong...nothing was proven in court....so why did you have to pay the money when you didn't do anything wrong then???It was more than one person but yeahWhy just say things that you can EASILY fact check? The $32 million was for **one** person—Lis Wiehl.  I don't understand this growing culture of confidently spouting wrong information. The reason that guy was confused is because [millions in settlements were paid to at least five other women as well.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-20170401-story.html) But, yes, we just learned about this $32 million one that was paid to one victim.It's still a 2 sec google search to fact check. If someone is unclear on facts of a situation, why even chime in? That's what I don't get.   On topic: The amount O'Reilly has shelled out between all of his settlements just goes to show there's some major dirt he's trying to keep under wraps. We literally have a President that does this on the daily. He will say he didn't do/say something and it get's disprove in a matter of hours by a simple video clip of him saying/doing said thing as early as a few minutes ago. It's no surprise the mass of idiots will follow in his footsteps.Didn't she take an out of court settlement? You got your money, if you wanted him in jail I guess you should have brought it to trial. People don't go to jail for sexual harassment. It isn't even a crime. It's a civil offense you can sue for.Wikipedia implies that sexual harassment is a banner term that can include sexual assault or sexual abuse. I would assume that jail time hinges on the severity but taking a settlement in lieu of a trial prevents any conviction or record of legal transgressions. Oh okay. I was just talking about actual harassment, not sexual assault.I have a recollection of seeing criminal sexual harassment charges mentioned in the last, but I'm too lazy to google it. Could be a crime in some jurisdictions, depending on the circumstances and severity. Took you long enough, Meg.It really doesn't matter whether what Megyn Kelly says is true or not.  She was complicit with the goings on at Fox News when she worked there.  Ms. Kelly is all about fortune and fame.  She is self-serving, and for her to pipe in now proves it.   The stars have aligned, and the broken clock is momentarily right about something.lol...whats next? Weinstein gets his old job back? Fox should be ashamed to even consider hiring O'Reilly back. So much for cleaning the swamp. Trump Supporters support Bill O'ReillyThey support Trump, who himself has been accused by &gt; 10 women.Makes sense but I wonder why they are so offended by Harvey Weinstein?They aren't actually offended by Harvey Weinstein. It's all part of their game.It's like when they tried to argue against taking in Muslim refugees because they claimed Muslims are anti-gay and anti-women. As if conservatives give a shit about women or gay people.There's a difference between Weinstein raping women and O'Reilly making inappropriate comments and emailing porn.Fox and O'Reilly deserve to be blasted, but Kelly isn't exactly a credible source, either.You may not like the woman at FOX, I don't and esoecially not her but when tons of women all report the same story, it's credible. I'm sure they all got together and said "what is the best way to ruin our careers and the life of our co-worker (who they agree with or they're really full of it, it's not like they're democrats) that innocent man? Oh I know, let's all make false claims together!"It's not like she didn't leave the organization she was making millions at for a shitty NBC gigLike oh yeah I'm going to believe Bill Cosby against 50 women who've known him, some with tons of their own money. That's so ridiculous.
Can we all take some time to appreciate the sole comment left on the article by a "Donna McDonald": "Are we American the bad b*tch on this planet we b*tch slay the f*ck right out of russia and let their know we don't play with there trick A$$ we let their know we mean business."*Russians read the comment* "On second thought, we don't need Twitter bots to influence elections, they've got this" Over/under on it being a Markov chain?Damn right Donna.Huh. Well, I can't argue with that.I mean, she has a point. I have no idea what it is, but I'm sure it's in there somewhere.'Donna McDonald' sounds like something Trump would come up with while trying to set up his troll accounts."Hmm... Donald McTrump.... Denny Donaldo... Daniel Tromp... Donna McDonald...""I've got it! DANNY DEVITO!"Totally. It's "John Barron" all over again. I love Juggalos....and I'm not even an ICP fan. Poetry. Pure poetry.What is a Juggalo?A Hulkamaniac!He powerbombs motherfuckersIn to thumb tacks!That person has voting rights. That person couldn't tell you the difference between the Soviet Union and Russia, or tell you what a government is, or what the powers of her own President is. And she's not the only one, she's just one of those who can just barely express what they think is going on. I wish I could laugh at this, but there's thousands of people like this.. fix the public schools!This is gold. They are always criticizing the west, but never Russia.Because Russia is perfect, sole leader of justice and truth in world. Everyone else lying, yes.That's how propaganda works, everywhere. Consequently, if your news source stops criticizing an evident, fault-worthy party, it has become propaganda.     EDIT: In this Age of Trump, we have dropped the ball on Democratic Party criticism. The recent 60 Minutes piece on legislation which hamstrung the DEA was passed with Democratic appointed Justice Department appointees, who should have sounded the alarm bell. Instead it appears they were colluding with drug distributers to thwart the DEA. As far as I am concerned it is as big a bombshell as the Bush Era's financial crisis, since so many lives have been ruined and lost to opioid access.  I'm not disagreeing with you, but Mike Papantonio does a solid job on that network.  He's been calling out some of the bullshit corporations have been doing for a long time now (the opium epidemic, poisoning water sources, etc.).How about the fact that he is being paid by a murderous dictator to further Russia's policy goals. In direct opposition to his own country. He is a traitor and the world will be a better place when RT is banned from all NATO countries.Isn't anyone working to expose bullshit by the U.S. Gov't and/or corporations in direct opposition to the U.S., then?  Your logic is overly broad.Calling the administration out (any administration, whether it be Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump) on bullshit like corporations poisoning our water supplies, pharma companies freely buying our senators and getting free reign to push insanely addictive substances on the public through doctors who were either too greedy or dumb to know the difference to patients who put trust in the system, or how banks destroyed Costa Ricas economy before the hurricane did.By your logic Daniel Ellsberg is a traitor.There is a difference between being paid to be a Kremlin propaganda mouthpiece repeating Russian talking points to foment discord, and legitimate criticism of an administration's policies.

Regardless of where they are hosted on the planet. Russia's been ruining the internet for everyone.  How about we ruin theirs a bit?If we want to 'ruin' Russia's internet we would give their citizens free and anonymous internet. That's about the only thing out there that actually scares Putin. Please look at how many page hits they get a month and compare it to other sites, RT was barely influential. Especially considering they have no US television channels, you have to go to their website to view any of their content. It's not like RT was being forced on people like CNN is in any airport. Free speech?Only for US citizens not companies, especially foreign entities.Corporate personhood is a thing. [Citizens United v FEC](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/08-205) found that corporate spending on political campaigns was protected by the First Amendment. Companies do have rights.The right to free speech precedes any government. Just because you’re not a citizen the government can’t lock you up for saying something.Eh, laughing at Sessions in a hearing would do that.Sure but they can shut down your business.Do you think it is healthy for a country only to allow local news? Especially the US new ecosystem is in the hand of a few companies only. No, it isn't. It's also not healthy to allow unobstructed propaganda from Russia masquerading as news.CNN and Fox are also propaganda. You should at least try and get all the different flavours of bullshit so you have a wider perspective Fox is certainly propaganda, and CNN is definitely flawed. But there's a difference between these organizations, as flawed as they are, and a straight up state news network. It's not really comparable. RT explicitly serves the interests of the Russia state. Fox explicitly serves the interest of the Republican party. CNN explicitly serves the interest of the bottom line of the Turner Broadcasting Group and Time Warner. They are all flavors of bad, but RT and Fox are clearly worse in my view.I think CNN is just as agenda pushing as the others, they just do a better job of pretending to be a legitimate news organization. Like when Wikileaks caught them colluding with the DNC to fuck Bernie so they told people it's illegal to read it.Donna Brazile doesn't equal CNN. And as shitty as that was, it has nothing to do with the fact that RT is a state news agency that literally crafts their stories to serve the interests of the Russian state.The agenda CNN serves is making money for CNN and Time Warner. They help Trump a lot more than they did Clinton.&gt;Like when Wikileaks caught them colluding with the DNC to fuck BernieThis literally did not happen, and I'm sick of hearing it.What did the leaked correspondence say? That the **Democratic** National Committee wanted a **Democratic** Candidate, instead of some Independent who slapped a "D" behind his name a month ago?***THE HORROR!!!***Have you ever actually watched RT or do you just repeat Democrat talking points? I have. It's obviously heavily biased toward Russian interests. This is not a surprise given that it is funded and backed by the Russian government. RT has repeatedly been found to produce "materially misleading" information. Here are the sources describing the UK media regulation body conclusions:[Ofcom has ruled that a government-owned Russian television station breached the broadcasting code in its coverage of the conflict in Syria.](http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/ofcom-rules-against-russia-today-over-syria-conflict-report)[UK regulator Ofcom backs BBC in Russian TV case](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34316047)Are you actually interested in what this organization does and why, or do you prefer to just swallow Russian propaganda?O wow it’s not like the BBC or any of the US channels have ever materially misled the public, you must be too young to remember the coverage of the Iraq war There's a difference between flawed and credulous journalism and straight up state sponsored propaganda. It's not that hard to tell the difference, and RT is clearly the latter.Oh look, it's the false equivalence fallacy. I certainly don't see that one ten times a day.I agree. No illegals should be allowed to speak.Lol yeah raid all foreign media offices in the United States for saying things the government would rather you not hear.Do you watch Thom Hartmann or any of the other progressive hosts on RT? They certainly don't hold back against Trump.Larry King, Ed Schultz, Lee Camp.. they're so Russian Hillary is not a nation, but you are right, it was her who got him elected.  She presented her nomination and election as inevitable, alienated one-forth of the electorate, and painted anyone who disagreed with her as a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, jingoistic, xenophobic, misogynistic bigot.  No wonder she lost.Ed:  added “jingoistic”.

RT is owned by a Russian political party, very similar to Chinese party news. Which Russian political party owns RT?It's not really. It is owned by a private company, ANO TV-Novosti, with a large portion of its funding coming from the Russian Government. Neither is associated with a particular political party, though.When Trump hasn't signed the sanctions which Congress overwhelmingly voted for, why the hell do you think a news organization is going to listen to anything the government has to say? [Wrong](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/02/politics/donald-trump-russia-sanctions-bill/index.html)&gt;President Donald Trump signed into law Wednesday morning legislation that levies new sanctions against Russia and restricts Trump's own ability to ease sanctions in place against Moscow.Signed, yes. Implemented, no. And he *was* supposed to have implemented them by now.[Again, not true.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-senate/trump-slow-to-implement-russia-iran-north-korea-sanctions-law-senators-idUSKCN1C42YF)&gt;on Friday, the White House issued a presidential memorandum taking the first step toward implementation by designating different agencies to start the process putting the law into effectThis was 10 days ago. And if it hadn't been implemented, the person should say he's delaying the implementation, not lie about what has already happened. Your own link confirms what I said. He's done literally nothing to accomplish the task that should have already been completed, except to say "It's that guy's job". Meanwhile "that guy" is showing absolutely no sign of doing the job either.And 10 days ago, he wrote the title sentence of something that had a deadline of 3 weeks ago. Woo.(Edit: Oh wait, not 10 days ago. That was "last Friday", from an article published on the 29th of September. That was a full **31 days ago**. What's been done since? I'll give you a hint: The answer is "nothing.")Yes, that person should have correctly said signed instead of implemented, but the fact remains that Trump has shown absolutely no signs of actually implementing something that Congress passed with *overwhelming* approval back at the beginning of August. That was 3 *months* ago.These *are* facts to attack Trump with. It's not making things up. He's obviously not going to do anything to hurt the guy who made him president.(Another edit: [Here's a link from yesterday](http://time.com/4992612/lindsey-graham-trump-russia-sanctions/). Still nada on implementation.)Even though I'm on the other side of the political fence, I salute you for your truth.Thanks friend. I have no problem attacking Trump on facts, but it's really not helpful to anyone to make stuff up to fuel a conspiracy  theory. No worries and I agree. Speaking personally, I find the frothing hatred toward Trump to be frustrating. There's plenty to legitimately criticize. No need to make up stuff.Except, this isn't making something up. 3 months ago, Congress overwhelmingly passed sanctions. Trump has completely dragged his feet on implementation, providing none of the requested information, nor taking any meaningful steps toward even planning the actual implementation. It's fairly obvious he has no intention to put these sanctions into effect, he's just stalling by "designating different agencies to start the process". It's just like when Congress sends a bill to committee to die.This is a man who lies at every turn, and never actually takes action until he's forced to. (Example: Promising to donate to charity, then never actually following through until he gets called on the carpet over it.) I have literally zero faith that he will implement the sanctions without some outside action being taken to force his hand.I like the frothing hatred, it seems to be justified.The article you posted basically argues that Trump has been dragging his feet when it comes any aspects of the sanctions, except for the memo that was released.their boy Trump won't make them“Is our news so innocent?”&gt;Trump: "You think our country's so innocent?"I'm just trying to imagine the reactions of my conservative friends and family if Obama had said the exact same thing or something remotley similar, under any circumstances.

THE MAN LITERALLY BRAGGED ABOUT FUCKING SEXUAL MOLESTING WOMEN ON TV YOU FUCKING DOLT.Jesus christ you people need fucking mental helpWhy would they register as a foreign agent? The US is under Russian influence from Putin, so RT is no longer inside a foreign nation.Comrade Donald's ranting tweetstorm is imminent. /sSo what exactly is the difference between RT and say the BBC or CBC? [Russia Today Anchor Resigns, Admits To Spreading ‘Lies’ For Putin](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5598815)This was in 2014, but unfortunately RT is still here. There is a line between reporting the facts of a story, and mispresenting and altering those facts to maintain a narrative. RT shits on that line masquerading as objective news. It should be labeled as  Russian-sponsored lying* propaganda, like the French PM Macron said of RT and Sputnik News standing next to Putin.Edit:  http://www.france24.com/en/20170530-macron-rt-sputnik-lying-propaganda-putin-versailles-russia-france-election OK. But none of that makes any difference as far as all of those news networks being *foriegn agents*. They're all government owned and operated news channels. The fact that we want RT to register as a foreign agent should only have to do with their foreignness. Not the benevolence of the content, or this becomes a free speech issue in a super UnAmerican way. Management structure. The BBC &amp; CBC are separate from their governments in day-to-day operations, all of their board members are publicly announced and have term limits. RT claims to have a board, but it's members and structure are secret.None of this explains why they aren't considered foreign agents under the foreign agent registration act. The language used to define such things has nothing to do with the structure of the business. It only has to be an agent of foreign principal, which being owned by another government should qualify it as. **Foreign Agent**An "agent of a foreign principal” or "foreign agent" under FARA is anyone who, on behalf of a "foreign principal," engages in political activities, acts in a public relations capacity, solicits or dispenses anything of value within the United States, or provides representation before any agency or official of the U.S. government.**Foreign Principal**A "foreign principal" is a foreign government or political party, a person outside the United States (unless a U.S. national), or a partnership, association, corporation, organization, or other combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country. An entity organized under U.S. law is not a foreign principal. However, if an entity organized under U.S. law is owned or controlled by a foreign entity, and the activity undertaken benefits the foreign entity, then the foreign agent may be required to register under FARA (e.g., a U.S. subsidiary acting at the instructions of its foreign parent). Note however, that there is an exemption from registering under FARA where the lobbying activity is only in the form of "private and nonpolitical activities in furtherance of the bona fidetrade or commerce of such foreign principal." Other exceptions under FARA include certain religious, scholastic, and scientific activities and legal representation during a judicial or administrative proceeding.I don't really care if we want to register RT, but if we do then we need to have the BBC and CBC register as well. Or this is about free speech, and only censoring what our government doesn't like, and that's totally fucked and un American. The fact that RT is basically the Ministry of Truth from 1984, but for Russia? They aren't a news network at all, they are just a propaganda arm of the Russian Government.Quality first of all. RT is terrible at their jobs. They tries to say the US government controlled airlines with the FAA. No RT, regulating something isn't controlling it.Quality is not a factor in the Foreign Agent Registration Act. BBC and CBC agree with their narrative. RT has always had some great programming, Larry King, Jesse Ventura, Adam Kokesh, etc. Well, for one they don't give a flying fuck about unbiased reporting.He said the difference.  ;-)The cherry on this cake is Russia's insistence that every opposition news source registers as a foreign agent or gets banned as "extremist media". Only some years too late...They're just following Manafort's lead.Has FOX registered as a foreign agent? Or Alex Jones? Arenas like those are where the real damage is being done.I don't think you know what "foreign agent" means.they obviously are one, why even register?  it’s in the name lolThat's not why they have to register - they are literally the propaganda mouthpiece for Russia, unlike the BBC which is ran separately from the government and has people with limits and can be held accountable. doesn’t RT have some level of abstraction to its management at least superficially resembling the BBCThey claim, however, their members and structure are not public, so there is zero evidence to support that.None of that makes any difference based on what the law, Foreign Agent Registration Act, says man. **Foreign Agent**An "agent of a foreign principal” or "foreign agent" under FARA is anyone who, on behalf of a "foreign principal," engages in political activities, acts in a public relations capacity, solicits or dispenses anything of value within the United States, or provides representation before any agency or official of the U.S. government.**Foreign Principal**A "foreign principal" is a foreign government or political party, a person outside the United States (unless a U.S. national), or a partnership, association, corporation, organization, or other combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country.

Other exceptions under FARA include certain religious, scholastic, and scientific activities and legal representation during a judicial or administrative proceeding.Those are the definitions, and all foreign government owned media outlets should apply. IDK why YouTube always suggests RT as news. It's BSIt sounds like they don't want to operate with a license.Still waiting on those sanctions to be enforced on Russia. The deadline was 3 weeks ago.If they don't want to follow the law, then its time to kick them out. They're nothing but a propaganda outlet for Putin and the Kremlin. The fact that we allowed them to operate in the US for so long was a nice diplomatic gesture that Russia have abused. I mean it's in the name. I doubt anyone thinks they're reporting from Oklahoma or somethingDuh. That's because they're *secret* agents.It's great that RT does not want to be registered as a foreign agent.Let's see when the  USA federal government will stand up publicly against freedom of speech and especially against the right of believing others' info or propaganda except its own.Yes, comrade.

Yankee Imperialism?

At least with RT you have the luxury of knowing exactly what that bias is. Sure they might not cover Russia influencing US elections but if you want to actually find out about what the US is doing over seas asides from "fighting for our freedom" you're much more likely to hear it from RT than you are from CNN or Fox.I watch or read a metric shit ton of sources, including RT and Al Jazeera. Sure, the latter two have biases and slants, but no more so than US sources, whether they be private sector or government run like VOA. Intelligent, well-educated people are able to use their critical thinking faculties to sort out which stories are likely to be bullshit and which may have some substance.

The attacker, after being apprehended, told investigators he had been in "telepathic contact with Felgenhauer" for five years.Well we might not be blaming Putin for once. Trump Supporters love PutinRussia is their friend.  Russia is their ideal for how America should be run - an illiberal strongman with total power who murders or jails anyone trying to speak truth to power and who uses the government to enrich himself and his family.That's their idea of making America "great."&gt; an illiberal strongman with total power who murders or jails anyone trying to speak truth to power and who uses the government to enrich himself and his family.And it's disturbing and at the same time they bashed former Presidents claiming they displayed these characteristics, it's almost like they don't know what to believe.Actually, that sounds like the Clinton crime family.

I don’t know what a slasteriskt is. slasteriskt sounds like a badass gamertag.Congratulations, you're now a mod of /r/incels.No.  The gang members would be mods on incels, and the above commenter would be banned for pointing out that attempting to "slut shame" a woman who refused your rapey advances is self-contradictory.Fuck this man needs a parade. And a medal.Bangladesh is in Asia and it’s nowhere near the Middle East.  It's closer to the Philippines. Unsurprisingly, the rapists were also morons.I mean, the middle East is in Asia tooI think the convention is that the middle east is a transcontinental area inclusive of Egypt and European Turkey.That aside, Bangladesh is on the east side of India from the Middle East, so to suggest it's arab in any way (which isn't even all of the middle east) would be to argue that India is as well.(I take your point though, so I tweaked the wording of my reply.)The Middle East stops at the eastern border of Iran.  I wish more people would realize that.Which is why it similarly annoys me that people on reddit will say that countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan are in the Middle East.  They are not.  Afghanistan is Central Asia.  Pakistan is South Asia (by convention), but it's geologically almost split in half with the eastern half in the South Asian subcontinent and the western half on the Central Asian plates.the whole Osama 9/11 situation happened. then the middle east came to be defined as West of India to Turkey. we weren't going to Asia to invade Afghanistan, we were going to the middle east. They're xenophobes, they aren't expected to be that conscious about race and nationalities.Bangladesh isn't close to the Philippines kek, it's right next to India and Burma. Which is where the whole "you can't be racist against a location/religion" argument tends to fall apart. Did the article say it was in the ME? I used to be suprised how many people thought Afghanistan and Pakistan were in the ME, now it's a suprise when they know it isnt.No, the article said the would-be Italian rapists called her an "Arab cock sucking whore".The article said the men were Italians who were harassing herDoesn't say that at all.I have a big map of the world on my office wall and I remember an old boss of mine pointing out the places he had been to on his European vacations. He said he really enjoyed traveling but he would never want to go to the Middle East because of all the terrorists as he gestured roughly in the area of Thailand. Men who carry handkerchiefs tend to be wholesome.Not if they have chloroformOk, maybe avoid those who specifically ask you to smell their handkerchief... :( But if the man who offers you his handkerchief is a florist you know it's going to come out smelling like roses.If its even true though there is no police report on this just a facebook post The entire story seems pandering and fake as fuck but there's far too many gullible people around. [deleted]tabletop character creation be like"my character is a"*flips coin*"heroic"*rolls dice*"Bangladeshi"*draws card*"flower seller"Yeah, gotta roll for it.  Otherwise, everybody'd just play heroic Bangladeshi flower sellers every game.  Have you played Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay? It had a random-as-fuck character creation system.My friends "managed" to be Elven nobles with magic swords and dwarven berserkers with silver axes.I came in late and rolled in front of everyone.Fucking rat-catcher with a club and a sick terrier.I would play the fuck out of a rat-catcher, more flavourAlso not actually a bad character path (weirdly).Yeah wasn't it on the path for assassin, which was the only way to get the max boost to # of attacks? This is my *very* loose recollection from over a decade ago.Also if you think that's random, pick up the Realm of Chaos supplements and role for a chaos mutation!Not only on the assassin path (think it's via cutthroat or something) but it gives you stealth skills and makes you immune to poisons in a game where blade poisons are both absolutely bullshit and likely to backfire. So essentially Charlie from Its Always Sunny?build is broken, game literally unplayableseeing as how its just a facebook post your comment might be more true than you realiseA weirdly controversial stance in hereI get the impression the woman who wrote the original Facebook post went through a similar process. Whoa. So, years and years ago, I was also saved (from a dude who roofied me) by Bangladeshis in Florence. They were (male) construction workers, not florists. But they were kind, concerned, saw that I was in distress, and they sat with me until the guy finally went away. So, yeah — while this is statistically a useless anecdote, I’d still say that if you ever find yourself in trouble in Florence, you might want to look for some Bangladeshis.Does Italy have a large Bangladeshi community?surprsingly larger than you might expectPersonally, I expected zero, so you're spot on there.I expected one, because of the article.Shoot, I just realized we're talking about Italy and not Florida....For some reason my dumbass thought it happened in Florida too until I read the article lolYes once they get italian citizenship they can then bring their bangladeshi wifes into the UK as it is part of the eu without any checks that say a uk citizen would need to bring over a foreign national. It is a loophole to bring people to UK where a massive bengali population live. On a side note- although a big generalisation- Bangladeshi people  are amongst the kindest you will ever meet.Even japan does this.  The so called ‘mecca’ for anti immigrant ideologues.  If I get married some day I can bring my wife on a spouse visa with me permanently.Interesting, I know the US has procedures for this, but they've really started cracking down on Southeast Asian wives.  You need to show you were in a serious relationship (e.g. you visited her AND she visited you before you got married).  The paperwork on getting valid marriage is also complicated:&gt; According to information provided by the U.S. consulate, before you can obtain a marriage license to wed in the Philippines, you, the U.S. citizen or resident, must first submit a "Legal Capacity to Contract Marriage" from your embassy. Unfortunately, the U.S. embassy does not feel it can provide this exact document, and will instead give you an “Affidavit In Lieu of Certificate of Legal Capacity to Marry.” Some of the local registrars have been known to refuse to accept this affidavit; you will have to find one who does accept it.I have a friend of a friend who is a still waiting over a year later to try to get his wife in.  Apparently, they had to crack down because there was increasingly marriage fraud where the couple gets divorced as soon as she gets her green card (and American spouse leaves a bit wealthier).They'd have to wait two years.Ironically, the whole process is so clinical that I think a meticulous lying couple has an easier time than a legit couple.People do not ‘buy’ south east asian wives in japan though.  Also since I am indian, I have no dearth of suitable matches back home(hah) unless I marry a japanese.    Japan doesn’t let your parents in though. A bit sad actually but I understand their logic. They don’t want to burden their social welfare system with immigrants’ parents.Quite large. They are usually portrayed as small shop owners in the local imaginary. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb417Z5Vp08) Giancarlo Esposito (Gus Fring) as the head of the "Bangla" comunity in a recent film.what the hell is up with florence and shady ass dudes.so many stories like this.  i was in florence this past summer.i was with a friend hanging out at piazza di santa croce (about a 10 minute walk from where this happened) and my buddy and i were sitting on a bench eating dinner.there were a group of 4 girls on the bench next to us with a bottle of wine also just hanging outa group of 5 guys came up to them and started talking.  i thought they were friends maybe.  we didn't speak a lick of italian.  we didn't really pay attention.  but about a minute or so afterwards, the guys started getting kind of aggressive.  then shoving started to happen.  and the guys started grabbing their arms.so my buddy goes over (he never minds his own goddamn business, i've been dragged into at least 10 bar fights with him over the years) and asks what the hell is going on.  of course.. i just sit back and wait for it to get physical cuz... that's what always happens.but luckily, this time, after some confrontation, those guys just walked away.that experience and these stories are starting to mess up what i thought Florence was, a nice safe romantic city.  it's apparently rampant.Went to Florence on part of a European trip with my female cousin and myself (also female) when we were about 24-25. Went to a bar restaurant and were approached by two nice looking guys. They were seemingly normal after a few drinks they said their parents restaurant was next door and they had to roll some gnocchi before they opened the next day. So we walked next door. Shots commeneced and gnocchi rolling happened. We were prettttyyy tipsy but had our wits about us still. The guys then showed us back into a store room for more shots where they kept the good shit. They all of a sudden presented us a bunch of coke. We didn't want to do lines of coke and started to back out of the situation. They got aggressive with us and grabbing at our chests and butts. We basically made sure we had our purses and phones and got the fuck out. The whole way out the door and onto the street (it was only about midnight) they were calling us bitches and sluts and American whores. They were true assholes.that sounds like a fucked up experience.  im sorry that happened.it's hard imagining what it's like to be a chick.  i'm a solo backpacker so whenever i meet solo female travelers going out and partying... i'm always... AFRAID for them.  i always wonder how the hell they do it.  they must have to stay super vigilant at all times.i'm a 6' 230 lb dude, so i never have to worry about these things.there's been a couple times during my trips where i'd meet solo females at my hostel, and they would try to tag along with me to explore, after learning that i'm harmless (lol).  then i'd feel really bad for wanting to make a move because im supposed to be their safety netYeah I've been to Europe 5 times and that was the fifth. I had learned all the tricks by then so o felt pretty confident getting out. Most European men that act like that aren't willing to get actually violent so if you tell them what's up and say fuck you and walk out immediately it'll typically be okay. Still sucks that it happened but the key to staying safe in Europe is to put "safety nets" like you described in place before allowing any guards to come down. And to never actually get fucked up beyond repair. Also acting tougher than you are works wonders. I ended up spitting in that guys face as we walked out the door. Yeah something is definitely hostile and strange with the young guys in Florence. I've heard disturbing stuff from a friend and his wife (both stationed over there) about the way women are treated 'after hours' and how violent they can also be towards American men in particular. No idea why, at least they never explained it. [Yep](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/780n88/woman_saved_from_gang_rape_in_florence_by_heroic/doqkt2a/)My friend (acquaintance?) has a similar story but instead of Bangladeshis it was Sikhs. They saw one of the guys holding on to her arm pretty roughly and they came up stood in a circle around her until the guys left. Didn't try to fight the guys, just stood shoulder to shoulder around her.  So I guess look for Sikhs and Bangladeshis. Sikhs are so badassAny info on the attackers? Shouldn't the police be trying to find out who they are? In the US, people are usually given the description of the attackers to help find out who they are..Edit : Found out this was from a Facebook post, and not a police report. Now I understand why there is no suspect information.A couple other articles list the attackers as 25 Italian men. Which, if Italy has roaming bands of 25 men wandering around trying to rape women then shit's already gone totally out of whack.Try being an attractive (blonde) girl at night/any nightclub in Florence. I studied in Florence way back in university and girls in my class (particularly the blonde ones) were constantly hounded (verbally and physically) by Italian men just while walking at night and especially in the nightclubs where men would grab/pull them by the arms or buttocks to dance with them. This would not fly where I live and if you did that here you could expect an immediate slap to the face. This also happened on the streets in the center itself in the public eye. There are many friendly and polite Italian men, but there is also a huge culture of machismo and aggressive "flirting" particularly amongst some young Italian men. I really liked the culture of Italy, however, this overaggressive machismo soured the trips of many of my female classmates who had previously idyllic notions of meeting "romantic, handsome Italian men" before the semester. Again, obviously not all young Italian men are like this, but this is definitely an aspect upon which Italian society could improve upon.There's a reason we have quite a few teenagers dead outside of discos during the summer. Say the wrong word to the wrong guy's girlfriend and you might get something more than a beating. It's rare that Italian girls go to clubs and such alone, so foreigners are usually easier targets.Yeah one of my friend visited when she was like 14 with her parents. Guys were super aggressive hitting on her even when she was with her mom. EU gotta stop those damn immigrants cuz they're rapists, amirite?[They are nearly 5 times as likely to be](https://www.tpi.it/2017/09/01/stranieri-stupri-italiani/#r). The statistics are mostly from the ISTAT (National Institute for Statistics).Not sure if sarcastic Obviously sarcasmIt is sarcastic I'm sure Poe's law at workLooks like the real concern is 'dey tuk r jerbs' from European born rapists... To make matters worse, you've got immigrants like that guy *not* letting them rape!But italians never had jobs thoDrr trrrr urrrr jrrrrsD’tkrr jrrrsDrrrrrrrrrrrrr jrrrrrrrrrrrrYeah look at what happened to polish couple in Italy just two months ago ....Tldr; immigrants in Italy brutally gangraped a Polish woman while her Polish husband watched.You do realize this story was made up, right? She's pro-migrant and very outspoken based on her facebook history, it's like the opposite of "MUSLIM STREET RAPE GANGS ARE FLOODING THE COUNTRY" far right headlines. "ITALIAN RAPE GANGS ARE ROAMING THE STREET AND IMMIGRATION IS THE ONLY CURE". Way too convenient.It's quite well-known that Italian young men are quite a bit more handsy than average. On our international trip to Rome we were even warned about that. This is nothing new. Not everything is intended to attack you. Sometimes things are just true.I believe every story about Italian young men in this thread because they're all realistic. There's no Italian roaming rape gang stories.She claims they all filmed her so if this story is true she should post descriptions of them and go to the police, they would have likely uploaded it to social media. I'm not right wing and I don't live in Italy so it's not like I have a dog in the fight I just know bullshit when I see it.Eh, wouldn't be new to Italy.  I had a teacher in high school who's from Italy and he told us how his dad raped his mom before they knew each other, and in Italy the woman married the rapist to save her honor.  The practice of rape-and-marry was common in Italy until the recent few decades.[deleted]Italians shouting Arabic insults?It says in the article that when she was saved by the florist they called her an "Arab lover" or something like that. So they are probably local Italian youths. So they would have liked the woman to be gang raped??...wow racists are some evil peopleIs that really why we need to know? Because all of us redditors have a good chance of coming across one of these guys on the way from the computer to the bathroom?Ha, look at this kid; not redditing on the toilet.Hey everyone! This guy doesn't have any hemorrhoids!! Look at him.. all lali da walking and sitting without pain.  Well aren't you special Mr No-Hemorrhoids. Gooble gabble...one of usI mean... Redditors aren't the only ones who read The Independent. I don't see how giving *more information* would be detrimental to the situation, so why not?Because the story is most likely fabricated or embellished. Because there is no more information to give. Just so we're clear this information comes entirely from Gaia Guarnotta's Facebook, not the police. Looking at her facebook profile Gaia Guarnotta is a feminist, who supports socialist and anarchist movements like antifa, and supports refugees entering Italy. She made this facebook post in a time of a lot of high profile refugee rape cases in Italy. Never trust someone who is comfortable enough to tell everyone on Facebook and not the police. If you left it at *don't trust someone who posts on facebook*, but yeah, social media posts from any political spectrum shouldn't be given much (if any) weight without some sort of confirmation.This will probably ruffle some feathers, but in my experience reading news stories any time the victim goes to social media before the police in a serious crime the odds of it being a hoax shoot up dramatically. When the story is that a roving band of **twenty+** men tried to do this to her and neither her or her hero contacted police my skeptical meter rises significantly.Just like when any crime story is attempted to be used to claim a trend... anecdotes are no replacement for data.&gt;political spectrum shouldn't be given much (if any) weight without some sort of confirmation.It needs to be given context. Currently Italy has had a lot of major news stories about refugees and migrants gang raping women. A woman who's political views encourage migrants and refugees comes out amidst this political event to claim the exact opposite happened, that a horde of Italian men tried to rape her and a migrant saved her. Her political views are highly relevant to it. Description of criminals at large seems to be something the public should know yes...In a lot of European countries (not sure if this is the case here), this only happens if the police think that they can't find the perpetrators and if they think the public can add useful information.This wasn't even reported to the police. The only evidence we have is a Facebook post.The victim's facebook post cited in the article says they were "italani", which I believe means these were local Italian men.&gt; Mi si avvicina un gruppo di mmm saranno stati 25 ragazzi ubriachi (italiani), scherzano, mi chiedono un selfie, ridono… io volevo andare via ma vabbè si sta allo scherzo.Google translated:&gt; I'm approaching a group of mmm there will be 25 drunk guys (Italians), jokes, I ask for a selfie, laugh ... I wanted to go away but well you are joking.Translation is a little off, I believe "mi chiedono" is "they ask me" so they asked her for a selfie.&gt;The victim's facebook post cited in the article says they were "italani", which I believe means these were local Italian men.&gt;&gt;&gt; Mi si avvicina un gruppo di mmm saranno stati 25 ragazzi ubriachi (italiani), scherzano, mi chiedono un selfie, ridono… io volevo andare via ma vabbè si sta allo scherzo.&gt;&gt;Google translated:&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I'm approaching a group of mmm there will be 25 drunk guys (Italians), jokes, I ask for a selfie, laugh ... I wanted to go away but well you are joking.Your translation is off. It translates to:A group of...mmm... must've been 25 young, drunk Italian guys approached me, joking around, laughing and asking me for a selfie... I wanted to go away but whatever, it was just a joke (obviously meaning at first she thought that she had misjudged the situation)&gt;handed her a roseI don't remember Tuxedo Mask being Bangladeshi. &gt; while all the others were filming on their mobile phones." At least we know she didn't stumble onto the brightest bunch.So wait, when it was one woman against 25 men the odds were hopeless, but when it was one women and one old bangladeshi flower seller somehow the odds were in her favor???Happens. A man who tried to mass stab school children in China was fended off by the school janitor lady with a broom and an elderly retiree with a prop sword. People who do these things are often cowards.Wait what is that?China has lots of mass stabbibg incidents because they dont got access to firearms.Scummy douchebags are like this. They don't respect women at all, but when one guy steps in they run with their tail between their legs.They're not there to fight, they're there to be pieces of shit. And she didn't take photos of the group once she was safe?One of the rare moments i see my country’s people mentioned and the comment is full of racist people... Dang ppl what makes you hate us so muchI actually like bandladeshi people, they're usually pretty chill (at least here in Italy)They hate you because they have no reason to hate you...they wanted this story to be the other way around bangladish man tried to rape some blonde woman but was saved by italian men...i wouldnt be surprised if this news is twisted around and spreading in those echo chambers when i heard someone got rescued from a gangbang i just had to know what country requires heroes to rescue women from gangbangs.this is a news article posted over a uncorroborated facebook story from one person, get this trash out of this subAny evidence this actually happened?A website said it happened so it must be true. feelings and thingsNo police report huh, what a nice country yet local people want to introduce diseases into their countrymen va Facebook va fake nearly happen rape headlines lol. Why is "saved from gang rape" in quotes?  I'm guessing it's because that's the way the lady stated it in her interview. I think from a journalistic standpoint, if they didn't use quotes they would have to be more accurate in how they described the situation as it allegedly unfolded. "Woman saved from group of physically aggressive men" or something like thatThanks to being jaded from too many internet headlines (and the occasional visit to /r/suspiciousquotes), I was immediately put in mind of an obnoxious older-sibling type pretending to be about to shove me down a hill, not doing so, then saying "Saved your life."He looks like an Orc captain in shadow of war If it was 3 guys, I'd be far less skeptical. But even if there were just 15... was there a football match? How did 25 like-minded guys glom together to roam the streets at midnight? Let's say she miscounted, 20. That's still a lot of people.It's not as if Florence has had any sort of history with this sort of thing either from what I can find. The most recent being two police accused of raping a tourist. But gang rapes I really can't find anything on so this seems very out of the norm.Something just seems off about this story. Not saying something didn't happen just the bubble on the level's off. yeah this is like that british glamour model that was kidnapped in italy not long ago, only she wasn't.Yeah, I won't be satisfied until I experience true level here.I know you got some down votes... but I’m kind of there with you.  If this really happened, I’ll be very apologetic.  But it seems unlikely 25 guys were going to rape her without a single one having a moral conflict.  Maybe some video will emerge to prove the story.  Let the down votes roll in... Wait, you don’t know gang rapes are a thing??I wish I was that naive. 25 men, who you specifically note are "Italian", try to gang rape you in the middle of Florence, and you are saved by a single Florist who you specifically note is Bengali.While all this happens, nobody contacts the police including the woman herself. And let's not forget that the women making the claim is a committed and open far-left political activist. There's obviously a reasonable case to be made for cyncism here. Let's be real here: the main incidents of mass sexual assault in the last several years in Europe have not involved large crowds of European men. No amount of wishing or Facebook lying by the author of this post is gonna make that an inaccurate claim. This shit does happen [Australian reporter raped by  mob in Egypt](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1381710/Lara-Logan-reveals-terrifying-details-mob-sexual-assault-Egypt.html)That doesn’t change the fact that gang rape, done by any demographic, does happen. That seems to be what the person I was replying to was implying. No, it wasn't what he was implying. What he was implying is that gang rapes by a group of 25 people are exceedingly rare.&gt; it seems unlikely 25 guys were going to rape her without a single one having a moral conflict.An individual having a moral conflict in a mob doesn't change anything.Except they were stopped by an individual, right?ITT: people criticising others for taking the story out of context, the others doing the same, all the while the story itself almost certainly fabricated in the first place. *That's Reddit!™*&gt;Ms Guarnotta said she had decided to post her story to show why feminism is important.What? I've got a strong hunch the Bangladeshi flower seller was not a feminist. The world just needs more good people like him in it. These comments are gonna be a shitshowEdit: These replies are already a shitshowEdit2: I'm still not sure what's going on.Yeah it's weird, like lots of people just post dumbass comments only a few words long that have no real relevance or meaning. It's like they are all selfish and just view the world through their own eyes or something. WHO KNEW human's were so complicated!I think that most of what's going on are people just getting really pissed off towards opinions nobody actually holdsVery weird that not a single of these 25 men is identified by now."After she refused, the photographer from Livorno said she was called a “stupid b****” and a “whore” This sounds like my OKCupid inbox. I love that the end turns this into feminism is misogyny.Women are also capable of the kind of thing. If you think they're not, you haven't been to a sorority party.is this a normal thing in italy?What a wonderful man. You would think that an older man and an immigrant might be afraid to step in for fear of being beaten by such a large group, maybe even killed. But he just went right over and saved the day.This is not news. This is a story somebody put on facebook. This appears to be thinly veiled fiction. Why is this kind of stuff from the Independent upvoted? Do people really need this stuff to push their narrative? I'm a bit confused, why is it significant that the flower seller in question was Bangladeshi?Hearsay, anecdotal nonsense that seems to support multiculturalism and feminism, despite the fact that both these ideologies contribute to the majority of rape statistics in the West.No police report, no evidence other than word of mouth...This is kind of hard to believe, just a politically correct feel good story with no actual evidence.People who desperately hope this 'inspirational' story is true are desperately bringing the downvotes. Even when it's laughably obvious that this is a fabricated story by someone with a clear agenda to push.So much of it lines up in the dichotomy of the feminist agenda. Independent woman, attacked by a group of 25 toxic men, threatening to rape her at will because the patriarchy holds ultimate power over her, saved by a intersectionally and equally oppressed person of color, who later has racists slurs thrown at him. Especially since that's a pretty popular spot in Florence, lots of shops, restaurants, and tourists.It's slightly less busy super late at night but there's a fair amount of people around at most timesMan Europe is just not safe anymore.Good thing he could speak their language. 27 people?Is this article about his gesture or his ethnicity?They mention his ethnicity a lot for the same reason they mention the perps ethnicity not at all.   They are pushing an agenda.    There is no police report on this just a facebook post from a self described feminist thats it  This is like a reverse Final Fantasy 7 prologueSpeaking of which when is that  FFVII remake coming out? Been waiting.It's gonna be awhile. When it comes to Final Fantasy games Square Enix has never been one to rush (Kingdom Hearts 3 being released next year after being announced over a decade ago).Evil flourishes when good men do nothing. This man stepped up and Evil was stopped. [removed]

"Begaye took Mike from the van to a secluded desert area, where he raped her and killed her with a crowbar"Other than a coffin, prison is the only place this animal belongs. This animal doesn't deserve a coffin. Maybe just a hole at best. fuck that, throw his ashes in the dump.buzzards gotta eat same as worms. That seems like harsh punishment for the other garbage at the dump.Damn. If I'm reading correctly the Navajo tribe doesn't support the death penalty, but in this case they did. And he only got life sentencing. Sad storyThe article says that the killer is intellectually disabled. Perhaps the prosecutor determined that his cognitive abilities are low enough that a death sentence wouldn't be constitutional.Don't disagree with anything you said, I just thought it stood out that the Navajo Nation president said they would of supported the death penalty. would have*I only read that the case prompted *calls* for the NN to reconsider it's opposition to the death penalty, not that they actually made an exception in this case. Did I miss something?&gt; Russell Begaye told The Associated Press he informed prosecutors that the tribe would have supported the death penalty for Tom Begaye.That's where I drew my conclusion from. Russell is the Navajo Nation president, who unfortunately shares a last name with the killer.Used to live there and "Begaye" name is as common as SmithHad no idea. Thanks for the info. I had to re-read the article multiple times Just re-read it, and it would seem you are correct. Although why he said "would have" rather than "did" confuses me a little. I remember driving past all the balloons and flowers tied to a fence near Shiprock and wondering what happened. Terrible story. That movie Wind River was very much about how there is no proper system for reporting or finding missing Native American women.Fucked up.That statistic at the end of the movie was heartbreaking.I wish America had a Black Dolphin type prison. Russians have it for the most dangerous individuals. We have supermax prisons.  A lifetime of solitary might be the most severe "humane" punishment we posses.  There is no physical danger but the mind has to find a way to cope with the isolation.didn't US have a prison in the Carribean that have a land border to Cuba?Criminal civilians don't go to a military prison. Yeah, plenty of the ones in Gitmo weren't convicted, so they were just plain civilians, not criminal civilians.Did you genuinely miss the point or are you just trying to argue about politics? Any given country doesn't send their own civilians to a prison located on a military base and designed for prisoners of war. The Gitmo-people weren't prisoners of war, they were (and are, the ones still locked up there) labeled "unlawful combatants". Lots of them are innocent, and if they're not "unlawful combatants" they're just plain and simple civilians. They're not even criminal. Therefore, innocent civilians *do* go to military prison.Jesus Christ I wasn't making a legal classification of these people. Call them whatever you want. Again, normal countries like the US don't send their own convicted civilians to military prisons, military prison camps, POW camps, unlawful combatant camps, unlawful combatant detention centers, or foreigner torture circuses. Are you being willfully ignorant? This isn't politics. These are factsI didn't say they weren't facts. And the accuracy of his statement doesn't matter. Did you read what I said? He (and presumably you) missed the point of my comment. He could have said the completely true fact that water is wet and it would have not mattered just as much because that's not what the discussion is about. Supermax Colorado, Alcatraz of the Rockies. It's where they keep all the serial killers, terrorists, gang leaders and the worst of the worst. The only thing I think would do justice to this man is the torment for the rest of his days in solitary confinement, guilt ridden and haunted by what he has done. Insomnia, night sweats, endless tossing and turning. A slow grind towards insanity caused by his own crimes.Rather have him in prison for life.  Prison doesn't seem ideal for pedos.  ......He is getting a life sentence.He’ll probably be killed in there.The NN President and killer are related?No... Begaye is a very common last name on the rez I feel like we should just turn criminals like this into slaves. Death is too quick and prison just lets them be. Have them do grueling manual labour for the rest of their hopefully short lives.[deleted]Who were his ancestors and what did they do?

I am the gay. He's probably just a little bit poofy!I miss the shit out of this show. I really wish it went on for a couple more seriesWhat show?Little BritainComputer says no :'(Maybe she thought you were CornishCornish Liberation Front!I'm American, living in Holland. Recently a friend's mother told me I spoke "surprising good English for being American"Gotta love that Dutch bluntness.Speaking as a linguist...The General American variety of English (as in, all of North America) is by far the most common among native speakers. The populations don't even compare.GA *is* English now. British varieties are now non-standard.And the Kiwis and the Aussies (same variety) never really had a chance.I'm happy to hear that but won't be rubbing it in anybody's face anytime soon - whether from an English person or not, there's this feeling of "let's not kid ourselves, you don't really speak *English* in America." Especially when it comes to jobs. I'm passed over for jobs all the time because I'm not a "native" speaker. I've been asked for certifications proving that I'm fluent in English (while we conduct the interview in English!) Just recently, I had to provide a reference from an English person who would affirm that I speak the language properly. In the Netherlands apparently everyone speaks English but me.Haha, honestly that makes the Dutch sound retarded, like they actually think Americans don't speak English.To be entirely fair, I've experienced the same with Germans, Belgians, French, and the English.In the case of the English, it's a joke. We do the same thing right back at them. Because honestly if you are a native English speaker and you legitimately think Americans don't speak English, then you are so stupid that I am surprised you can draw breath.Certificates are the new norm, whether the language is your native one or not.Crazy. My wife actually had to go through some BS like that here in the US. She's a surgeon and is from South America. Her native language is Spanish. She had to go take some certification test before she was allowed to speak Spanish to her patients in Wisconsin.In Texas they'd never impose such a burden.She had translators try to muscle their way into rooms, and then the worst part is they'd translate *wrong* and she knew it. She got in trouble for speaking Spanish one time before she got certified.All that being said, "the new norm" is still retarded. I don't even use the word "retarded" anymore, but holy crap there is no other word for this phenomenon that I don't have a choice but to sound like a bigot against the handicapped.Speaking from a non-linguist standpoint, English is and always will be the language spoken by the residents of England.You can say that American English is the dominant dialect but you can't say it defines English.Also fuck Webster, OED is best dictionary.As a Canadian, to me the OED defines the English language, Webster's defines the American Dialect.I mean realistically the differences in the language are pretty minor. It's not like British people speak "proper" or have better grammar.The US has some incomprehensible accents, but so do the English (well, the Scots, who would fight me for calling them English). Though I think the worst accent is a London accent, because it's just grating. Those first couple seasons of Dr. Who were like nails on a chalkboard whenever Rose opened her mouth.That is what they tell you but if you do the same back they think you are rude, it is not bluntness. They can dish it but will not take it from a foreigner. I am in the same boat, American now living in NL and married to Dutchie for almost 2 decades.  Haha ain't that the truth. It's an interesting culture, for sure.To be fair, I've met Scottish people and they may as well been speaking Klingon.Just wait til they’ve been drinking... drunk Klingon is even worse. Any person who can put together a full sentence without stopping for another hit of meth is impressive to the people of Florida. Florida isn't even remotely near the top meth using states. In fact, it's ranked 34 out of 50 for overall drug use.http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/msnbc/Components/Art/HEALTH/070401/AP_METHUSAGE.gifhttp://www.businessinsider.com/graphic-how-widespread-meth-is-in-the-us-2016-6https://wallethub.com/edu/drug-use-by-state/35150/[Methdesto, CA](https://www.google.com/search?q=methdesto&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP5Kq-_oTXAhUKxYMKHWkNDb0Q_AUICygC&amp;biw=1745&amp;bih=920) checking in. Having grown up between here and central Florida, Florida isn't even close, good mushrooms though.Pasco county, Hernando county, by US 41 between 52 and 50 is the best in the world.   New Port Richey checking in. Well been since like 2001 that I've lived there &gt; Pasco countyI used to live in Zephyrhills ;p209 represent Well....that's awfully close to Stockton....o.o Oh my god. XD"Methdesto." This is the town I grew up in, and I haven't heard this nickname for it in years.Which is sad, because there's a lot of meth in Florida.Yeah about that... see you have tons of old people living out the rest of their peaceful lives to balance out that number.If you ever want to know then visit Polk fucking county. If meth isn't the reason behind Florida being the most insane state in the union, then what is?Because Florida is the most open about it - http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/how-floridas-proud-open-government-laws-lead-to-the-shame-of-florida-man-news-stories-7608595&gt; Since 1909, Florida has had a proud tradition that all government business is public business and therefore should be available to the public. That means all records, including photos and videos, produced by a public agency are easily accessible with a few narrow and obvious exceptions. Public officials are also required to open all of their meetings — even unofficial ones — to the public.TLDR: Florida doesn't have more crime, Journalists just have more access to court documents enabling them to write more interesting stories.That's quite the TIL.Carl Haaisen said it was basically because the warm weather attracts a lot of people looking to get something for nothing. "If you steal cars, do you want to do it in Minnesota, in the winter, or would you rather do it in Florida?" I'm sure his books caused a fair amount of nashing of teeth at Florida chamber of commerces. (His time as a reporter there led him to write a bunch of great books that basically featured Florida Man.) Bob Dylan said of Hibbing, MN it was too cold to be badHaha,  funny how that skips over prescription pills.I find that personally offensive, as a Floridian I can tell you, the meth heads have burnt out over here and moved away because this place is “bullshit and there is too much drama” they have gone to other states and moved onto heroin. Florida is a proud flakka state and I reject your proposition that we are still a bunch of meth heads, we have moved on sir, you should too.[deleted]we say "like" instead of "uh".Californian here. We usually use "like" in this sense: "so I saw this hobo feeding his dog, and I was like 'I feel so bad for the dog, dude.'"Man, you're like, Hella gay. [deleted]Chicks can be gay, too.Aren't there gay chicks too?[deleted]Lived in the bay area for 20 years.  You mean to tell me there are people there that speak English?  I had no idea, I wish I had talked to my Asian neighbors!That was always our joke, in the Bay Area there are so many Asian families and honestly they all speak perfect english.  For someone from the pacific northwest that was such a shock.  You expect some broken accent and it's Hey! Like what's up?![deleted]There was like this guy and he had like a gun and was like shooting and then everybody was like totally deadDont forget hella.That word is hella Califiornian.Pffft, I'll see your "like" and raise you a "hella". As in that's "hella" cool.Source: Central Cali.Hey, not everyone in Florida uses meth. It's mostly bath salts anymore.A friend of mine was an exchange student from England in high school. One time a girl was talking to her as they were waiting for the bus and this exchange happened:"Your English is really good!""...I'm from England.""Yeah, I know, but your English is really good.""Yes, I'm from *England.* I'm *English.*""...I know?""We speak *English* in *England.*""...Really?"There were so many times in that year when my friends and I felt compelled to apologize on behalf of all our countrymen.That being said...I've spent quite a bit of time in the North (of the UK) and I regret to inform you that it is no better. I've been complimented on my English as well. "I'm American.""Oh! I wondered what that accent was!"Really? You've never seen an American TV show or movie? Here, turn on the TV right now. I bet we can find a show where people are talking *exactly like me.*As a non-american - its weird you watch an American tv show and people are just talking without an accent, but you hear an american talking irl and the accent stands out. And it goes the other way too if i hear an Australian accent in an american tv show it stands out like a sore thumb as well, but i hear them every day and dont bat an eye.Americans have a TV accent, and regular regional accents. The TV accent is the one everyone understands while the regional accent is the one everyone does subconsciously.For instance you can tell if someone is from the southern states or if they're from new jersey, completely different accent. Of course there's some southern states that are completely missing the southern drawl.Celebs tend to "train" themselves to ditch the regional accent so they can sound like they're from anywhere in America, hence the TV accent.It's called Standard American English and it can be difficult to adopt. There are still words and phrases I cannot, despite years of training and practice, remove my regional accent from.I have no idea why you would want to abandon your regional accents.  I'm a Canadian, but for 10 years of my life I grew up all around the states (Cali, Louisiana, Ohio, eastern Washington) as an immigrant from India.  The regional accents are beautiful.The southern drawl.   The black vernacular (the first time I heard "You don't think it be like it is but it do", I understood exactly what it meant, and I was so tickled and happy for my exposure to Louisiana inner city black culture).  The Ohio drawl (probably all through the rust belt, but I associate it with Ohio and northern Kentucky).Since I grew up in these various places, my english accent is basically "standard american", but with a slightly easier ability for me to drop into regional slang.  The diversity of speech, slang, and sheer insanity of english's "every word is welcome, come on in", is incredible.English is not my native tongue, but it is what i speak most fluently now, and it's my favourite language in the world.  The language with no pretense, no pomp.  The gutter language, where the king is equal to the pauper.  Where the highbrow and the lowbrow coexist with ease and can be mixed fluidly.Professional reasons, not full time. I've worked in various parts of the entertainment/media field for years. Sometimes in front of the mic/camera, S.A.E. can increase the P.A.Y.Heck, you might even speak American okay if you practice enough.Please say this American sentence: I’m going to grab the flashlight from the trunk so I can see what the problem is under the hood of this sedan.English translation:  I’m going to fetch the torch from the boot so I can see what the problem is under the bonnet of this saloon.I'd replace 'problem' with 'trouble', but either way.Thank you, my English is lacking as my native language is obviously American and top notch.They'll get really excited when you tell them about how they burn fags in England.All while getting excited when they “smoke fags” in England, too. 👄 Am English, spent my teens in America (Missouri of all places)... you have no idea.From St. Louis, I feel so sad for you I am happy you escaped though. They might have assumed you were German, we get boatloads of Germans down here Nah, Florida gets planeloads of Germans, and boatloads of Cubans.I can't decide if that person is ignorant that America didn't invent English or just stupid.If people could stop telling me what I’m fighting for that would be great..Pretty sure it's a paycheck and a 50/50 chance the VA will fuck up your care when you need it the most.Hey it's more than I got. There is 100% my healthcare provider will fuck up my care as soon as I can't afford itCould have swore it was the right to party...Hey now that GI bill was also pretty sweet, I have no debt from university.Oh shit, you're right.  My bad.  People who hide their views behind the troops are intellectual cowards."You think our troops are fighting for you to call me a coward?! You're no American!" /sFor my right to partySigh, you're supposed to be fighting for your own right to party! It’s in the constitution!The ConstitutionLiterally what every service member swears an oath to protect.We did, but that clearly means something different to a lot of people.Plus, most people have never served - we are the 1%! - so they really have no idea what our overall missions are. Like, Coast Guard gets the sea borders, NG gets the land borders, Navy gets the trade routes, marines get the enemy in the face, and army chills in other people's countries forever. I'm not sure what the air force does, but they're awesome and you should all totally join them instead.The Constitution, afaik, represents the foundations of our nation, and that is what we defend. The Constitution is supposed to be an evolving amendable document, so the intent is really to defend our *nation* from all enemies foreign and domestic. I think it can come off as *actually* patriotic because we all know that sometimes your nation makes mistakes and it is on all of us to correct those mistakes to preserve our liberties; the other option is to roll over and lose them, like it seems we all have for the past couple decades, and I think keeping the wars endless really helps out with that.Thank you. I haven't served, but I've known dozens who have and every one has said "we swear to defend the Constitution", or some variation thereof. Even friends that join for political reasons come out with an apolitical view of the Constitution (though sometimes it's bias in bias out).I consider myself a patriot in that I like my country a whole lot, I think the Constitution is a neato document and the fact that it has an amendment process makes it all the better. I could go on here about how we have rolled over and lost so much about what makes the Constitution good (believe me), but I think you're absolutely right about how we've forgotten just how important some of it's tenants are. The second amendment has become such a blind talking point for some people that I can't respect somebody that hides behind it in talks of gun control (and I say this as somebody pro gun rights); if you really wanted to "protect the other amendments" like you claim the 2^nd's purpose is, you'd have been forming a militia for open rebellion since the so called Patriot Act. People get mad at presidents for behaving like dictators, but every election flock to whomever makes the most declarative promises and, well, acts the most dictatorially because they project a strong man that can "win." Never mind the president's powers are clearly laid out, we'll just pull the "state of emergency" card and let the executive orders keep on running.I don't consider myself a liberal, or a conservative (and I can make an argument for both), but the way we've disregarded the Constitution is partisan to neither extreme. We've lost a sense of civics in the US, and it's gotten to the point where most people haven't read the Constitution (it's less than 5,000 words, for context the Canadian Constitution has over 32,000 with all of its edits). Do I think people should be *forced* to read the document? No, that'd be a hypocrisy I'm too aware of, but I do think we have too many damn nationalist that don't actually know fuck all about their nation and are just morons using an artificially constructed meaning for the Constitution to project moron talk onto. Sorry to go off on all this, it's been a long day, and I'm buzzed. The fact that they had the audacity to call it the Patriot Act still riles me up.I know a veteran that thinks like you do, and I respect the resistance to the insane overreach of politicians and gradual degradation of rights. I think the constitution is *sort of* nice and all with some decent ideals... But at the same time, words on paper don't really mean shit. It's people that resist oppression, and civil rights have never been a real deterent to state violence. Governments and politicians *literally always* try to gain more and more power and the only thing that's actually going to stop that isn't the constitution. It's communities building power bases that can take care of themselves and resist centralization.This isn't even getting into the problems with the document itself i.e. slavery is still legal according to the 14th amendment and that it was been used to illegalize alcohol.It's pay and benefits right?Punish the kids for defying/questioning authority! Obedience!!!I had a teacher that would say "Question everything, especially authority. That's what students should be doing." Then of course she would immediately shut down any student that dared challenge her 'amazing' ideas.I mean, I had already lived abroad and needed to itch my travel bug... plus they were making me a navy photographer so fuck yeah!!I joined just cause it sounded cool, that was the only reason I needed.Let's be real, though. You don't really get to decide what you're fighting for. You get to decide why you joined up, and you get to decide what value systems you think you are protecting with your service, but enlisted men and women do not have say in overall military strategy. They don't start and stop wars, they don't get to decide which battles get fought, they don't get to decide where they are sent and why. When you choose to serve, you are choosing to place your trust in your superiors, and they are choosing to place their trust in their superiors, and so on and so on all the way up the ladder to the person actually making the decision. Most of these discussions refer to the common solider. Not the general, not the high-level decision-maker, not the person who is actually starting the war and sending troops into actual combat situations where they fight and die whilst they sit behind a desk. A difficult job, to be certain, but let's not kid ourselves here. I think soldiers are a really easy target for people to take out their frustrations against the system, the man, authority, the military-industrial complex, whatever. It's not fair, but I understand why people do it, because when one joins the military, they are tacitly, and sometimes expressly, agreeing with the things that the military does, what it stands for, who it serves and why, etc. When one inserts themselves voluntarily into a bureaucratic system they are taking part of the responsibility for the outcomes of that system, which in this case is death, destruction, fire, suffering, torture, espionage, displacement, hunger, etc. We can also frame those things as freedom, liberation, protection, whatever, but all of those other things are means to that supposed end, and when one joins the military they are saying that those are acceptable means to take to reach those ends. The irony is that the person who is taking the part in the means, in the dirty part, has no real say about the ends.  In all honesty, you're not fighting for anyone's freedoms. You're fighting to further America's interests abroad.Troops fought for your right to shop at Walmart, stop insulting their sacrifice by shopping on Amazon.those strippers won't marry themselves for BAH and tricare, do it not just for America do it for Candy!Seriously, I would love it if people stop name dropping "the troops" to justify their ignorant bullshit.Yeah i signed up for free school that i sort of got i don't give a shit what language you speakYeah...were  you going for Lumbergh tone? That's how I read your comment. I hate when people say mindless shit like this in an attempt to sound patriotic.     How the hell are troops "fighting for our right to speak 'American'??? Who are they fighting against that are trying to prevent us from speaking 'American'?????"If English is good enough for the bible it’s good enough for Murica!&gt; If **American** is good enough for the bible it’s good enough for Murica!Fixed that for you, you Communist.Yeah, really. For a language called “English” to exist, there would have to be some country called Engl-land or something. Look at any map. No such place exists. Checkmate, communists. The worst thing is, you know that has been earnestly said by someone. I don’t speak English, you dolt—I speak Murican proper!!  🇺🇸 &gt;Who are they fighting against that are trying to prevent us from speaking 'American'?????"Saddam Hussein was going to ban the Oxford comma, and now Kim Jung Un is threatening the semi-colon.Those dictators, Trump and Putin, have a lot of disagreements about the Oxford comma.THAT SON OF A BITCH! what's next? Questiony the Question Mark?!Speaking American? No thanks. Navajo is a hard language to learn.and Cherokee, Algonquian, Sioux.....or Nahuatl, Aztec, Olmec, Mayan, Tarahumara, etc. Don't forget that indigenous American languages include those spoken in Mexico. (And Canada, too.)We as a country do not even have an official language, it is perplexing.Well, at the federal level, anyway. A lot of states have official languages. And even then, that would only apply to state documents,and, yes, what's *taught* in schools, but you still can't force the use of any one language from people as, the language anybody chooses to use would be protected speech, ie: I'm free to walk around saying "bloobnobo schlimoni ho di bob n'ma!" at people (and if I were still in school would be free to say it at teachers), and while I might get an F writing it on a paper, my freedom to say what I want supersedes any need to be understood. I don't disagree, actually. Exactly. My dad horrified me recently by wearing a free t-shirt for a WWII veterans charity he volunteers for (good cause, but...) that said, "If you are reading this in ENGLISH... Thank a veteran!" on the back....Uh....The US has never been in a war that would have put its Anglophone status in jeopardy. Never.Our founding fathers, however, *did* consider switching us to German!"We should all speak German?" "um...why?" "it's a really interesting language and I think everyone would enjoy it, come on it'll be fun and exciting and German sounds wonderful and not guttural at all!" "but we all speak English, it's the primary language of many of our citizens or their only language." "look George, I've been have a buddy of mine write letters to this chick in Prussia and things are getting kinda serious, and she's on her way here and she thinks I speak German so can you cut me a fucking deal here and we can all learn German together so I don't look like an idiot?"&gt; "but we all speak English, it's the primary language of many of our citizens or their only language."Actually up until word war 2 there was a quite significant German speaking population.It's a controversial claim, but there hasn't been a war the US has fought that has actually protected its citizens since WW2. Even then, some claim Pearl Harbor was already known and could have been prevented so the US wouldn't have to get into the war.Imagine, if there were actual travel restrictions throughout the world, the terrorists we're fighting in Africa, Asia, Middle East, and where ever else wouldn't be able to come to the US or anywhere else and carry out attacks.The only soldier or veteran I ever met who had fought for my rights as an American, was my grandfather who invaded Normandy. And he was, at the time, a Canadian serving in the US Army. He did get citizenship in exchange for his service though.Anyways, I'm not trying to say that joining the military isn't respectable or honorable, it is.  The issue I have is when people act like I owe my freedoms to the men and women of the US armed forces.  I don't.  My freedoms have never realistically been at stake in my lifetime, or even my parents' lifetimes.  At least not from a foreign entity. Our own government has been doing some shady shit since 9/11 that arguably violates our rights to privacy and protection from unwarranted search and seizure though.   A good number of Americans joined the Canadian military to fight in World War II before the US became involved in the war.   Estimates I've seen put the numbers at 10,000-15,000.    A good number of Americans saw it as their duty before their own country recognized that duty. In all fairness, there are always a good number of citizens of any country that want to go do some warrin'. It's just a major human thing.The counter argument is that the containment policy was necessary to preemptively stop the whole revolutionary brand of communism from gaining a global foothold and directly threatening the American government and interests. You can disagree with how it was carried out, or that it worked at all when compared to the whole "spend them into oblivion" campaign that really put the nail in the coffin of the Soviets and the "carrot before the stick" policy that eventually opened up China and Vietnam. But at the end of the day, one of the motivations for the wars was to protect American freedoms, preemptively. Iraq parts 1-2 were totally different of course. As for travel restrictions, the world is a safer place than ever and warring nation states are (mostly) a thing of the past due to the increased globalization fueled by the unrestricted travel of individuals who fascilitate the trade that makes it possible. Nowadays there's just no reason to go to war for most states, we're too entangled. Is local security compromised a bit? Sure, but in the world as a whole violence is down. I'll take the occasional terror threat over being drafted for someone else's war every day of the week. By the way has anyone ever PM'd you an Atari game? Well, how about them students for example, trying to stop the teacher from speaking American? Thank God the school saved us, I was quaking in fear.I heard Soros was behind their protest.This is what passes for patriotism when you're an ignorant fuck. I really can’t believe an English teacher said this...Given the point he was trying to make, it's not that surprising.  Also they should have staged it as a duel protest, as an English teacher who doesn't know we speak English should be fired.But duels were outlawed.Dual duels were outlawed. what about double duels down at the Dimsdale Dimmadome?Supposedly a substitute teacher.IIRC an English teacher that was subbing for another class (maybe History?)I believe it was an English teacher subbing for a Math class. She also had a history of saying such retarded shit in the hallways but nobody did anything till they got a recording of her saying it in class.She literally didn't know the name of the language she teaches. Some people are just gone&gt;I really can’t believe an English teacher said this...No, it was an American teacher. British teachers don't care about speaking American. there are Spanish speaking immigrants fighting for our rights too. There are actual Americans whose native and official language is Spanish and who are in the military from places like Puerto Rico.Fun Fact: There are also Americans whose native and official language is Hawaiian.Fun Fact: Per capita, American Citizens who don't speak English as their native language join the military at higher rates than those that do. Fun Fact: The official language of the USA is not English. We don't have one. Fun fact: 30 states have made English their official language.Illinois it used to be American not English which is kind of humorous. And all the Native PeopleBut the only place they can speak Spanish is in the mess hall, barracks or lounge. When they are working they have to speak English.Surely this will teach students a valuable lesson in life, right?!Probably some of the most important lessons they've gotten to date: that authority can be so wrong -- and that wrong individuals may be backed up systemically. They will learn that punitive and oppressive authority is weakened by righteous peaceful protest; they learned strength in numbers. And we shall see how this lesson ends, depending what happens to the oppressive morons. Beautifully said! I wish they taught an entire class on questioning authority. A little skepticism is vital for invention and it should be praised. We've seen the terrible historical consequences when our leaders go unquestioned. When people are silenced, so goes evolution. Or maybe a philosophy course or two, at the very least My parents always told me that the authorities were always right. Yeah, even as a mindless kid I knew that was bullshit.Exactly. "Respect the hierarchy!" isn't what troops fight for, or what this country was founded on. It was founded on equality, and I'll respect everyone as my equal unless behavior demonstrates otherwise. If someone wants to have authority over me they have to earn that.&gt;I wish they taught an entire class on questioning authority.If you've ever been in school, you know what this would turn into almost immediately.You have the right to free speechAs long as you're notDumb enough to actually try it-- The Clash, [Know Your Rights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lfInFVPkQs)No good deed goes unpunished in the end.Last time I checked American wasn't a language Well how often have you been checking? Any day nowY'ain't never been down South now, have ya, boy? Why do people who have never served in the military feel like they get to decide what the people who actually served were “fighting” for? That has to be annoying for veterans, constantly hearing shit like that.It is. It's kind of infuriating.1. We are not a group of people who all have the same opinion about anything. No matter where you came from, you can join the military. So there's the natural variability you see in Americans. Also, there are 4 services (5 if you count CG, even though they're under DHS not DOD, I met a Coastie in Iraq). There are so many different jobs, and so many different environments; so pretty much everyone had different experiences to color their perception.2. It's bullshit that they're making this political. Most presidents have made a policy of communicating with Gold Star families when they can, and visiting the troops who were wounded. I know Bush did, from a Soldier I served with that he visited. We knew in 05 that OIF was bullshit. That the reasons for war were wrong. But we also knew that we had made a mess of Iraq, and we needed to fix what we'd done. I'm sure Bush knew that he'd screwed up, too. It doesn't excuse a single thing, but I believe in letting judgement be saved for those wiser than I.Regardless, SSG Dreasky was a vehicle commander whose Humvee was hit by an incendiary IED. He and three of his crew were able to bail immediately, but sustained extensive burns repeatedly trying to re-enter the burning vehicle to pull the 5th guy out, until the vehicle exploded. Ultimately, his burns killed him, but prior to that, he was in BAMC in San Antonio when President Bush visited. SSG Dreasky broke into tears when President Bush entered his room, and Bush asked him why he was crying. Dreasky replied, "Sir, my whole life, I finally meet the Commander in Chief, and I can't even salute you." Bush popped to a parade ground position of attention, saluted SSG Dreasky, and said, "It's my honor to salute you." When Dreasky died of his injuries, Bush authorized his NG company to be recalled to active duty, flown by an activated C-130 crew to DC, so that they could all be there when he was buried at Arlington. He did some terrible things, and didn't stop other terrible things, but no man is a whole of any thing. He genuinely cares about the people hurt under his command, and I respect that aspect of him. No one talked about this. It wasn't in the news. And that's because it was all done to show families that we noticed and appreciated the sacrifice for our country.  Now, it's for approval ratings, and it's fucking disgusting.3. What in the fuck is going on with troops in combat in nations they aren't supposed to be in? And why aren't they being properly supported? We can drone strike people based on their cell phone signal, but we don't have these drones supporting troops in dangerous areas. I hate the idea of flying missile armed robots, but if we're going to use them, at least use them for force protection instead of executing people without trial.Wow, great response., wish I could upvote you more than once. Thank you for sharing that story of SSG Dreasky, it honestly moved me almost to tears. With your points that I am able to speak on, such as: Generalizing intentions, these terrible and intimate events for families becoming so political, our troops being in those combat zones the same as the beginning of the Vietnam War without proper help via QRF’s or like you said drones, and the fact our drones are being used for striking targets that usually aren’t confirmed the way they should be imo, I completely agree. Hell fucking yes. I've never agreed with what we started in the Middle East but I have immense respect for you and your fellows. I hope you're doing alright, friend, and you're getting plenty of support and love. Regardless of why, serving in the forces is incredibly hard no matter what you're doing and that deserves our support. I'm sorry you don't get it as much as you should.especially when those people had an opportunity to enlist during the Vietnam war and found that their bone spurs and such prevented them from defending freedom. This will be a peaceful and understanding thread.Bravo for these kids who were standing up for their rights as AMERICANS!But did they protest in American?Troop here: I'm fighting for your right to pay taxes with which I get paid and subsequently use to convert alcohol into urine.Christ.People we seriously need school reform.Your kids will have no chance in 20 years with education like this. Since the USA doesn't have an official language, doesn't speaking American mean speaking whatever the hell you want?Teacher here chiming in: She’s wrong and should not EVER say anything like that. She’ll likely, and rightly, lose her teaching license over this. The kids absolutely have the right to protest and should. But just like a public protest you have to follow some rules. Don’t disrupt the learning of others. Rally before or after school. Rally during lunch.  If you don’t want to be in her class get your parents to help you drop. If you’re 18 drop it yourself. Skip the class. Thing is there are ways of handling this within the rules that expresses your point but doesn’t give anyone the opportunity to say you were an adolescent punk. As for the administration, they have to draw a line with these rules or else they’ll have chaos on their hands very quickly. Next thing kids will be walking out because they don’t believe in algebra or something else crazy (bit of /s there). I think Dr. King's Letter from a Birmingham Jail explains it best:"Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was "well timed" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word "Wait!"........You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may well ask: "How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?" The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that "an unjust law is no law at all."As with others here, I'm leery of the idea of allowing the authority you are protesting to define the rules about what constitutes appropriate rules for protesting.  Yes, that's how it works sometimes, but it's not hard to find cases where this leads to abuse.And while we're talking about authority, it's unclear from this article that the authorities here took any steps to prevent the situation from escalating, or made any attempt to de-escalate.  For example, did they publicly suspend the teacher pending a review?  Or did they just:&gt; school administrators - including Principal Lawrence Pinto - made an announcement over the public address system warning that there would be repercussions for students who walked outTelling angry people to "obey me or there will be consequences" doesn't tend to make them less angry (imagine that).I'd expect more from the adults in the room, but maybe I just don't have all the facts yet.&gt; Thing is there are ways of handling this within the rules that expresses your point but doesn’t give anyone the opportunity to say you were an adolescent punk.The side behind what you are protesting will always label you something bad. If you always just follow the rules then the school can change the rules to control whatever they want. For all the people who keep saying "protest but follow the rules", please enlighten me to the conundrum I'd have if I were to protest the rules. Should I follow the rules that I want to protest in order to protest the rules about how I can protest? For all your "muh follow the rules", ya'll quite literally don't give a flying fuck about the rules when they *aren't* followed and/or hand out punishments when broken. Like those "I'm against illegal immigration because of law and order" folk who promptly start defending organizations like the ICE Gestapo when they violate all kinds of laws. What happened to the law and order eh?I mean seriously, the entire point of a protest is to break the rules to show one's disgust and anger towards how the rules function. The students wouldn't have had to protest if the school rules actually worked, instead of just excusing the teacher's moronic comments(which she has supposedly been doing for a while and was only caught red-handed due to this recording of her saying it). These pseudo-moderate pricks need to get off their high horses and pull that "muh rules" pole outta their asses.Idiot racist English teacher says stupid shit and the school just excuses her by saying the school is all for diversity? No fucks given despite the teacher getting nothing more than a wrist slap.Students protest because of the school doesn't care about enforcing rules against the teacher? HOW DARE THE STUDENTS BREAK THE RULES!Maybe you should examine this country's history of civil disobedience. Protesting is not about "protest, but as quietly as possible, within the box we draw for you." Go ahead and disrupt, kiddos! Be a fucking "punk" according to this asshole. Despite your condescension, they understand better than you do. Another teacher chiming in here.  The school has every right to give the students detention and the students are not wrong in protesting.  There are valuable lessons on both sides to be taught, learned, and discussed here and I am definitely going to make a lesson about this incident for next week in my Civics class.  You should be able to realize there is more than just one right and wrong here. If you're going to bring up civil rights protest, then it's important to mention many were arrested peacefully. They didn't run or wear masks and hide. They accepted the consequences of their actions. The way your post was worded made you sound like you were advocating chaos.That was all in an era before everybody had a camera and everything was being recorded and published online constantly. Also before things like the no fly list. Protesters have valid reasons to mask up these days. &gt; If you're going to bring up civil rights protest, then it's important to mention many were arrested peacefully.That doesn't mean it was or is right to arrest them.Since when is protesting supposed to be convenient? If protests were convenient, then they would accomplish nothing. &gt; As for the administration, they have to draw a line with these rules or else they’ll have chaos on their hands very quickly. Next thing kids will be walking out because they don’t believe in algebra or something else crazy (bit of /s there).I think it's a pretty safe policy stance to not side with the racist teacher on this one.  No, Patrick, American isn't a language.Why did the teacher get detention too? They clearly broke multiple rules by saying that, including the fact they outright lied to their students.If you can't do your job, LEAVE!At this point it looks like they're waiting for the whole thing to blow over and not do anything to the teacher.I grew up in Cresskill, so fuck Cliffside Park.I grew up in Emerson, so fuck Cliffside Park too.Don't you have to have some amount of intelligence and common sense to be a teacher? I know a few. Nope, you sure don't. All you need is the right paperwork.&gt; “fighting for your right to speak American”Obviously NOT an English teacher.Has anyone pointed out to the teacher that she was wrong yet?  I mean wrong in the factual sense.I am American but have been speaking English.. am I doing something wrong?Is there an administrative number I can call?  I want to leave a strongly worded message for the administrators explaining how I, as a vet, support the kids and their right to speak whatever and however they goddamn please.  Also how I do not support the teachers using the sacrifices of my brothers and sisters as way of trying to manipulate kids.  It seems the antithesis of education to attempt to emotionally manipulate those whom you have power over - you're basically reinforcing deference to authority as important,  instead of critical thinking.  If the founders did that, we'd all be speaking British English instead of American English right now.Americans seem really confused about the role their military plays in the world.No, they aren't waging war to protect you and your family while trying to stop innocent bloodshed. They exist to spread American atrocities, slaughter innocents in the name of democracy while enriching their elite class.That's some grade A, dumb-assery right there baw. Only teacher-does-wrong story that's not in constant rotation on Fox.Speak English. Talk American.
about damn time.half the time the fucking metrocard don't work.Well, you'll have Metro Card for a few more years it seems. &gt; The new system will replace the MetroCard, but MetroCards will not be phased out until 2023That's just legacy support. You don't _have_ to use them when the new system comes out. Just ask Hillary Clinton.&gt; Just ask Hillary Clinton.Your comment is marked Controversial - apparently people don't get the reference: https://youtu.be/9WvWNyQoFaw?t=26s I heard about a new invention called a token- it's a round metal thing that looks kind of like a coin. Maybe they will try those. I just created this thing called a 'token holder'. It can hold up to 10 tokens at once. Imagine the possibilities. Chicago just lets you use your phone so you don't need to carry anything extra around.And if it was 1936 this would be a fine idea.But now RFID exists. Much rather have a card linked to an account with a balance that can be recovered if said card is lost, stolen, or fails. Because it’s 2017. Yeah, because I totally want my every move to be tracked...If someone wanted to track your moves they would use your cell phone, not an RFID card.I can turn my phone off. I'm just saying this is an extra level of tracking that I'm really not a fan of. They can still track your phone even when it's off.Only way to prevent this is to completely remove the battery which, surprise, you can no longer do in most modern phones.Better have an earlier smartphone or flip phone.&gt;  They can still track your phone even when it's off.&gt; Only way to prevent this is to completely remove the battery which, surprise, you can no longer do in most modern phones.The conspiracy theorist in me is tingling. He's not wrong - unless you can totally kill power to the device (eg, remove battery), how can you be 100% certain that nothing inside is powered on and transmitting? (short of sticking it in a faraday cage)How early? Because I’m so down to have a palm pilotThen pay cash for individual rides. It’s still an option, no?But for frequent riders, this is how it works in 2017. Personally, I would rather have a convenient card that I can tap to get on the train.  The convenience of not having to handle bags of tokens or whatever is so much better than the possibility that someone cares enough to wade through the millions of daily transit rides just to see that I got on at 7th/Metro and off at 17th.You can but why would you, half the time you're on the train your looking at your stupid phone so you don't make eye contact with anyone and trigger yourselves into a fear of attack response....Then don't use public transport. &gt;  [N.J. driver discovers his E-ZPass is read all over NYC](http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/nj_driver_discovers_e-zpass_and_cow_monitor_read_all_over_nyc.html)I totally understand the hesitance of adding ANOTHER form of tracking.  &gt;In the city, information is collected on vehicles with E-ZPass transponders so that traffic flow can be monitored, but license plate numbers or drivers are not revealed.Wow, such a scandal...

I just mean that if it's tied to your account then you're recorded as getting on x train at x time.Hell no, I tend to travel alot. Last thing I want is having to carry a sack of tokens with me.never heard of themHopefully they don't contract the same company that did Ventra in Chicago. That rollout was an utter disaster. It's fine now...but goddamn was that a painful migration.RFID cards like they use at some ski slopes? - but at commuter jam time how else can you speed up the process? The gate has to open and close (or lock and unlock) for each person...there's always gonna be cheaters but by and large the vast majority of riders are willing to pay the costs...If we could get something that integrates with Samsung/Apple/Android pay I would be so happyAre contactless credit/debit cards fast enough for the subway?  I can't imagine them directly allowing debit or credit cards to be tapped and scanned quickly enough at the gate, I haven't seen a non-swipe system yet where there wasn't a necessary security verification process of 3-4 seconds for a banking card, and if you scale that up to how busy the subway is I don't think it'll work very well if it takes that long.  I was thinking more like they would just replace the metro swipe cards with RFID cards that may or may not have personal ID info on it (if someone wants to be able to replace their card when lost)Chicago already uses contactless payment for its trains/buses. Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay all work at their turnstiles, or if you're a regular rider you can have your pass stored on your phone through the Ventra app.&gt; Are contactless credit/debit cards fast enough for the subway? Yes, it works fine in Chicago. Works fine in Vancouver, mind you we don't have nearly the level of usage that new York does &gt; I can't imagine them directly allowing debit or credit cards to be tapped and scanned quickly enough at the gateVisit London. It works perfectly.I guess by 2023, I will no longer be using a Windows phone and will have moved to one of the more common phones.

Absolutely wonderful to read something like this today.In 20 years when I am going to need them hopefully they will have this worked out in a nice streamlined unit. I am gonna enjoy trying to become a bionic old man.
[Here's a NYT article with a bit more info about Magnitsky, Browder, and the Magintsky act.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/world/europe/russia-sergei-magnitsky-william-browder.html)BTW how effective is the Interpol wanted list? Since doesn't Russia currently hold Yanukovych who's also in the wanted list?I can't also help but think that this will cause some Streisand effect and get more countries into the Magintsky act.It’s effective in that it severely restricts your travel options. &gt; BTW how effective is the Interpol wanted list? It was enough to convince the Trump administration to revoke his visa. So let's put Putin on the interpol list Edit: and now am I on the interpol list?Ayyy comerade. No. Actually we feel same about Putin. Come for wine and women. Free. Political talk. Basement Secret Party. Will follow w details. We will pick you up no need for ride. Yes yes comrade, come to lubyanka square 2&gt; Edit: and now am I on the interpol list?You are. You're going to be arrested, and you'll end up back in the slammer with the rest of your family.Tragic suicide, he shot him self in the back of the head 3 times, sealed himself in a dufflebag and threw himself off a bridge. If only his family stepped in and saw the warning signs of his depression and spiraling out of control reddit use.I can highly recommend his book Red Notice. It’s pretty eye-opening to say the least, and I can imagine it would be especially so to those of you who aren’t directly affected by Russian politics and would like some context. It's truly stunning how terrible Trump and crew is with Russia optics. He will literally criticize every world leader at Press conferences and Twitter tantrums except for Putin/Russia. I honestly think this is more of a distraction at this point since he enjoys everyone focusing on the Russia stuff while he is doing so many other terrible things.The many other terrible things are a distraction from the Russia investigation. If he did collude with Russia, it would be the biggest political scandal in American history. He still hasn't put the new Russian sanctions in place and the deadline was three weeks ago. Instead most people are talking about his feud with a gold star family.It's because Trump dreams of having power like Putin's; he wants to be able to silence anyone who criticizes him.Because he thinks Putin is the only world leader that knows how to run a country. He wants to *be* Putin, and fortunately for us he never will be because he does not have the crazy background credentials - though he keeps hiring people who do, which is worrisome.Eh i doubt that. I think he is to cozy but I'm not going to say he admires Putin to that extent. Who knows though what he is thinking. I think Trump unfortunately enjoys all the misdirection he is giving the people of the world.And the State Department reportedly revoked his visa at the same time:http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/23/559463071/state-department-reportedly-revokes-visit-of-magnitsky-act-campaignerTrump cancelled his Visa?  http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/23/559463071/state-department-reportedly-revokes-visit-of-magnitsky-act-campaignerYes.well he was a U.S. citizen until he decided that he doesn't want to pay taxes anymore and gave up U.S. citizenship in 1998To be fair, the US is one of only two countries in the world that taxes their citizens on foreign earned income (the other being Eritrea). This leads many expats to give up their US citizenship to avoid paying income tax twice.They don't have to pay twice. Expats are generally allowed to use foreign taxes paid as a credit against their U.S. tax obligation.And for quite a few, that's enough to avoid paying taxes twice. For some it isn't. Also, it means every single American expat needs to file taxes in the US, which is annoying to say the least.&gt; Also, it means every single American expat needs to file taxes in the US, which is annoying to say the least.It can be pretty pricey too, depending on where you're living at.  In Germany it can run thousands of Euro to go through an accountant.  And if you still have property and financial holdings in the US, it can get dicey.  What are you going to do send the IRS to me down here?It might just take a phone call to your banking institution.good luck with their automated systemI do this. The maximum you get is $90,000. It's still absurd given that pretty much no other country does this and you're not getting any meaningful services beyond those provided at an embassy or consulate, which is largely paid for through fees.FATCA is one of the worst laws passed in a while. It treats normal, hard-working citizens like criminals and makes us go through an insane amount of paperwork and costly accounting fees even if we owe nothing.That's true, but only up to a point, and not for all types of income.Either way, you still have to file a tax return every year. For many, just relieving the paperwork burden is worth the cost of renouncing citizenship.Well, it is largely that way for two reasons. And honestly should be more prevalent. 1) (The US specifically) When you are the largest economy in the world you have no incentive to allow people to transfer wealth *out* of you to avoid taxation. And people are considered part of the wealth of a nation. Plus, you get to make the rules, so fuck you. China is starting to move in this direction as well as they make up ground on the US. 2) Additionally, you don't want people being an overall drain on your economy, which is one of the downsides of globalization and what wealth transfer threatens. If citizens are allowed to leave a nation and not have their income taxes, there is no incentive to remain *in* that nation. While this isn't particularly tragic for First World countries, in developing economies this loss of money and more importantly skill and knowledgeable individuals retards economic development and slows the elimination of poverty.Now there are arguments that push back against this, the most basic of it being that a country shouldn't have *any* concept of the ownership of a human being. But as long as the world is compartmentalized into nations these issues will stick their head up again and again.Unrelated, but Interpol is such a great band.  More of an AC/DC guy myself.

&gt;On October 22, the Forward mistakenly published a story recounting a woman’s allegation that she was sexually harassed by Elie Wiesel in 1989.&gt;The story did not meet our journalistic standards and has been removed.&gt;The Forward apologizes for this error.&gt;Read more: http://forward.com/news/national/385733/editors-note-about-elie-wiesel-story/I guess that takes care of that.If you know anything about Elie Wiesel, this was one of the most egregious fake stories I've seen.Why? Is it so inconceivable an old man from a different time might play some grabass? Dude's dead and this allegedly happened 30 years ago. It might not be fake, but it's definitely a non-story.The Jewish Chronicle isn't taking it down. Not up to their journalistic standards doesn't mean it's untrue. https://www.thejc.com/news/world/elie-wiesel-molested-me-new-york-geneticist-says-1.446445why are comments disappearing ??[deleted]I'm reminded of the ol' *if you have to ask* adage.[deleted]The story has been retracted, looks like it's either a hoax or unconfirmed. Innocent until proven guilty, folks. Innocent until proven guilty.[deleted]Nor can he ever refute the claim and clear his name.Plus wasn't he ruined financially by Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme? He was. Poor bastard never caught a break in his life.Story has already been retracted.By this outlet, the Jewish Chronicle and Salon are standing by it. Except in the minds of general populace he will always be a molester.The story has been retracted due to not meeting journalistic standards.It applies only in a court of law. The public opinion isn't bound to that rule, and that's the issue, anybody can accuse somebody of rape on Twitter. What will you do when it happens to you? your wife leaves you, you're employer fires you? Well at least Elie is rich and s/old/dead enough not to care &gt; Well at least Elie is rich and old enough not to care.And dead. He's also dead. As of a year ago.Kinda shocked people are forgetting this.If your wife leaves you because someone on twitter accused you of rape, maybe she knows something about your character that the rest of us don't. Funny how this is always the top comment and never the oppositeAs a survivor of sexual abuse, I take such claims very seriously. At the same time, media-driven hysteria has rarely resulted in justice for abuse victims, so I've learned to save my ammo for better targets.Unless it's a Palestinian kid throwing stones. Then it's shoot to kill.Wtf are you talking about?Let me hit your head with a slingshot and see what you do back.Are you literally questioning a sexual assault victim's claim?!?What is one supposed to do with a claim like this?Does one, by default, believe the accuser?  Even if there is no possible way to prove the claim? Even where the accused is dead and therefore unable to address the claim and defend his/her name?The common response to this is: "If a friend tells  says that their bike was stolen, do you require proof?"  Well no, of course not. However, what distinguishes a situation like this from that hypothetical is: 1) I'm in a position to judge my friend's credibility since I know them personally.  I know nothing about the person making this claim. and2) If my friend were to specifically accuse a person and say, for example, "Michael Davis stole my bike", I'm pretty sure that I  *would* ask them "How do you know that this person stole it?"  It would probably be one of the first few questions I asked.  When a person accuses a specific person - particularly publicly names them - there should be *some* standard of proof, shouldn't there?  Even if we assume that only 1 out of 100 public claims made are false, shouldn't we require *some* level of substantiation?I don't want to live in a world where claims of assault are summarily dismissed or discouraged and lives are ruined without proper recourse. But neither do I want to live in one where all that's needed to ruin a person's life is an accusation of wrongdoing without any other evidence.What's the answer here?&gt; But neither do I want to live in one where all that's needed to ruin a person's life is an accusation of wrongdoing without any other evidence.You are already living in such a word. You know what they teach male teachers, etc.?  You don't need to be convicted of anything to have your life ruined, just accused. And this is very unfortunately true.Hope we survive through this phase of "guilty until proven innocent (and then still publically isolated reguardless)". Since when did guilty by verbal association dictate a person's moral quality? Where just being named in any kind of negative fashion (even if completely incorrect, exaggerated, and/or made up) is enough to destroy a persons life.It's all just a new take on McCarthyism, just from the left this time. Before, you were a communist or gay. Now you're a nazi or rapist. &gt; What is one supposed to do with a claim like this?I suggest doing what I do.  Just shrug and get on with your life.Eh, to me it's a numbers game. One person and I reserve judgement. 10+ and I generally accept that some of them at least are likely true. I'm not sure where the line is. * The public treats rape accusations like Salem Witch Trials. Proof of innocence is impossible once the accusation is made. I've often asked in real life, on social and here on reddit; "what, to you, would be evidence of *innocence* of a sexual assault/rape allegation if you '**always** believe the victim'?* The judicial/legal system has a reputation of treating accusations like a joke - the question of 'did this happen?' is usually left to a "he said/she said" with a number of elements that often wax and wane between aggravating and mitigating at best and absolutely ambiguous at worst...how do you as a victim prove the truth when often the only evidence you have is your word?I have often wondered about this.  I am sure there are people who are lying about being harassed. Just saying it doesn't make it so. But who?  And how do you prove it? Obviously, it would seem Harvey Weinstein is guilty of, at the very least, some of this.  But he was kicked to the curb and became an instant pariah and Bill Cosby seems to still be at least tolerated.  Is that because he was more likeable in general and Harvey was not? Seems like if you are an asshole in general and do something bad, the sharks are gleefully circling and accusers are taken at their word. But if you are a nice guy and everyone likes you, they get mad at the accusers and justice takes longer.    Re: Weinstein vs Cosby, I think the difference is Harvey admitted it and asked for help, Cosby is denying allegations of wrong doing AFAIKAh you are probably right.  "On October 22, the Forward mistakenly published a story recounting a woman’s allegation that she was sexually harassed by Elie Wiesel in 1989.The story did not meet our journalistic standards and has been removed.The Forward apologizes for this error."This is what I see when I click the link. &gt; “The photographer snapped the photo,” she wrote. “Simultaneously, Elie Wiesel’s right hand had reached my right ass cheek, which he squeezed. The photo was over, the photographer leaned back from crouching over his camera, the group separated, smiling at each other, and Elie Wiesel immediately RAN, diappearing straight into the crowd of over 1000 people who were nearly all standing up. Already gray-haired at that time, Weisel’s agility impressed me as he fled the scene of the crime.”Really? He squeezed your ass, and you're crying sexual assault?&gt; Listman wrote that she is coming forward now with the allegation because she is “exhausted from the guilt, fear, and shame and mostly from the twenty-eight year long burden of keeping this secret in a possibly misguided overestimation of my own capacity and responsiblity to protect the world from the knowledge of something evil and ugly…For twenty-eight years, when I would see one of his works on the bookshelf of a friend or family member, see his name or face in the news, read him quoted or referenced, hear him lauded as some kind of Tzadik [righteous person], I would feel nauseous. I would think that he had fooled everyone and I would feel embarrassed on their behalf for having been fooled."Guilt, fear, burden, and shame, over having your butt grabbed 28 years ago? What a fucking drama queen.I agree she’s being a bit dramatic about it.  An ass grab is super rude, but it’s hardly the kind of thing that ruins lives.  If we keep lowering the bar on this it’ll become meaningless.  Not every claim is valid.Seriously. Human relations are turning into a fucking minefield because of some folks' hypersensitivity. I've had me arse pinched by strangers too, but I didn't internalize it and obsess about it for decades... seems like this utter non-event was a life-changing trauma for this lady.Sounds like you're a manSounds like you're sexist and insensitive to other's issues. Hm, where have I heard that before?Or maybe I acknowledge that men and women have a totally different experience when it comes to sexual assault. But even suggesting that will get you accusations of "sexism." lawlRemember when you could rape a woman on the street and no one did a fucking thing? Yup. Women are basically porcelain figurines and mentally underage their whole life, so we can't expect them to be adults about stuff, on the same level as adult men.&gt;Remember when you could rape a woman on the street and no one did a fucking thing?did you take drugs and watch fetish porn, then fall asleep, and are now misremembering this as if it had happened IRL?&gt; Yup.

Why exactly do you think victims don't come forward or why it wasn't illegal to rape your wife for most of this nation's history?28 years ago, a hand touched a butt cheek.First off, cone again, this is sexual battery, not sexual assault.And remember when you could also rape a man and get away with it? Yes, there's a false equivalency there, but in this case she's lying, so people like you coming out to defend her doesn't help anyone - especially the actual victims of rape, sexual assault and battery, etc.How is it sexual in any way? *It's a buttcheek.* We don't use those to screw. They're not even erogenous zones, unless you're really into spanking or something. It's like screaming rape over a charlie-horse.&gt; First off, cone again, this is sexual battery, not sexual assault.I'd argue it's sexual assault, but, semantics. Unless you're arguing from a legal standpoint.&gt;And remember when you could also rape a man and get away with it?

Who are the *actual* victims? &gt; I'd argue it's sexual assault, but, semantics. Unless you're arguing from a legal standpoint.Yes I'm arguing from a legal standpoint. That's a difference of years in prison.&gt; I don't see how this changes a single thing about my point. You're right. It really doesn't. Both my point and yours on the matter were irrelevant to the argument.&gt; That good ol' Reddit style ESP that only works when a woman is accusing a man of sexual assault. lolI noted my argument was a false equivalency (and honestly I shouldn't have even brought it up), but she is lying. And for it she should be investigated, ad at the least registered as a sex offender *if the court of law finds her guilty*. Also, what's ESP? I'm unfamiliar with the acronym.&gt; Oh well now that is an interesting perspective. Who are the actual victims? This should speak for itself. Actual sexual battery, assault and rape victims. Women and men alike. As well as those who have been falsely accused. Her lying only hurts their cause, as there are definitely ambiguous cases that can end with potential assaults/ and/or rapists being found not-guilty. In such cases, you're right that there is often victim-blaming from the scummiest people who will use cases like these to justify their points.ESP = Extrasensory perception aka being psychicAnd how again are you claiming this woman is lying? From where do your psychic abilities come from?The good ol' days.Would that matter?Yes, the implications are not the same. Men typically aren't having their asses grabbed and they're usually the one grabbing women's asses without consequence. I’m a dude that has defiantly had his ass grabbed by multiple women who didn’t think twice about doing it. It happens more than you think. I'm not saying it doesn't and I'm not attacking people here. I'm just saying more often than not it's men grabbing women's asses. I've had my ass grabbed by men and women. Do you have any numbers on that? I can’t imagine many men would report it so I doubt there are any accurate figures for you to say that most of the time it happens to women. Or I could be wrong and we do have some good evidence. I legitimately don’t know.No, I don't have any numbers. This is just from personal experience. Men don't really report it because we don't see it as a big deal, usually. This goes back to the idea that men are the aggressors and women are receptors in sexual situations.Are you traumatized? Did you press charges?  Against all ass pinchers, regardless of sex?No, I'm not traumatized. But I'm also not every person, nor do I know this woman's exact experience. But then again, why would I want to come forward if I'm going to be attacked for doing so?That doesn't matter. Truth is truth. Talk about crying wolf.  Give me a fucking break.  Truth is truth, so did he grab her ass or not? (I'm banking on the psychic abilities of redditors that only manifest when a woman is accusing a man of sexual assault)Agree this is more than a bit overwrought, but there *is* a certain spiritual trauma to realizing your righteous idol has feet of clay. I mean, imagine the furor if someone were to claim they'd been molested by say, JFK, or Bill Cosby?I don't even believe her honestly.  Even if it were true, she has other issues.  Everyone deals with things differently, but this seems a bit much.  Show me a woman who hasn't had their ass grabbed in a crowded bar or party.  You say wtf and move on.  It shouldn't destroy you.  I am not saying the guys who do this aren't jerks.[deleted]It's sexual battery. Huge difference. And there's no evidence, aside from her story. And confessionals can't be used in court without other evidence.[deleted]&gt; Different issueNo its not. This is a false sexual assault allegation. If he was alive, he'd be dragged through the mud and his life ruined by such an accusation. You can't do that to someone.which basically means the term sexual assault is meaningless now.This is where we are headed.  Also, a man can do good and be a horndog.  I'm not sure what that means, but it's true. Martin Luther King Junior and JFK both couldn't keep their fly zipped, and more recently US general David Petraeus was cheating on his wife with a (very attractive) married woman while also revealing secret documents to her as she was writing his biography.  Sex and power are tightly linked no matter what we want to believe.[deleted]It absolutely is, but that doesn't mean it's as soul-damaging and traumatizing as this woman makes it out to be. I should hope everyone is a little more emotionally resilient than experiencing decades of mental suffering from having their ass grabbed once by a stranger. That was my first reaction, but I'm not a jew. It might be different to be a jewish woman who feels like she has to hold a secret about an cultural idol. Didn't realize buttcheeks were a sex organ.*My god...* I just realized. Every time my folks spanked me as a kid, they were actually raping me! I must hold a press conference! To deal with the shame and the fear![deleted]Unless he put his wiener on her his erection is irrelevant.[deleted]it is, guys get boners from just looking. Is that sexual assault too?Just as no woman has ever destroyed a man's life by crying sexual assault when none took place, right?[deleted]Yeah, it *is* pretty wrong. But hey, at least she had the decency to wait until he dropped dead before smearing him as a rapist. Maybe you gals aren't *all* bad.Yes, some women have used the sexual assault cry to ruin a man's life. But, that doesn't also mean that ass grabbing is not sexual assault. Red pill much, bro?Now you're thinking with feminism.If this is assault, the entire NFL has been assaulted by their own coaches and teammates. Yeah, I can't count the number of times I've been sexually assaulted if that's the standard.everything is context. I was on a bus standing, minding my own business and felt my ass being grabbed. This was in another country where this kind of thing is tolerated. I went from feeling happy, secure, and enjoying my day to violated, nervous, and scared. I cannot express how much something like this can affect you. Let me put it in terms you might understand: you walk out to your car to see someone keyed it, or your mailbox hit with a bat, but also in a way that reminds you that you are just an object to someone else who wanted to remind you how vulnerable you actually are.Its an experience I will never forget.Come on dude, I know you are better than your comments.&gt; Really? He squeezed your ass, and you're crying sexual assault?Are you aware what sexual assault is?I've been sexually assaulted\* several times by women, even worse: some of the sexual assailants were *ugly* women.(\* they groped my butt without my enthusiastic consent)Great, are you doing do anything about it?He, like many others of sexual violence are afraid to come forward. I'm an adult.Cramming your genitals into/onto someone else's genitals or genital-resembling cavities without their permission, while beating or coercing them to obtain compliance. Also, possibly, titty-twisters and kicks to the nads.Not a fleeting round of grab-ass while getting your picture taken at a public event, in short.I remember this one time, over a decade ago, while working at a restaurant a female coworker approached me while I was entering an order and unexpectedly pinched my ass. It was absolutely unprovoked and completely took me by surprise. To this day I can still *feel* how excited and gitty it made me. My head probably would have exploded had she been a famously influential Nobel Laureate &gt; Really? He squeezed your ass, and you're crying sexual assault?I don't even have to click your username to know that you're a Trump supporter. No, he's right. Why hide sexual battery accusations for 28 years? Innocent until proven guilty.[Lots of reasons.](https://www.livescience.com/56482-victims-sexual-assault-speak-out.html)-There exists strong culture of blaming the rape victims/slut shaming in this country. I.e. "they were dressing provocatively," "good girls don't attract sexual attention," "they should have known better," "it wasn't that awful, quit overreacting," etc. /u/CaptainAlcoholism 's use of the term, "fucking drama queen," proves this point quite adequately.-Sexual assault is a traumatizing experience that can be extremely painful to talk about, even to a therapist.-The perpetrator may be family or a "close friend," and it can be hard to publicly accuse such a person. In fact, doing so may result in losing numerous friends or getting renounced by family members. If the perp was a coworker, the victim could be ostracized in the workplace or even fired.-The victim may fear that no one will believe them, and/or that they won't be able to provide sufficient evidence, and that the rapist will then sue them for slander. Many are coming forward now because they are comforted by the notion of 'strength in numbers.'She got her ass squeezed quit acting like she got raped. I got my ass squeezed a few times. I told somebody &amp; moved on, I didnt hold it in for 28 years because it was just THAT traumatic.&gt; quit acting like she got raped.Again, you guys are accusing the victim of overreacting, which makes it very hard for them to come forward about assault, being groped, etc.&gt; I got my ass squeezed a few times. I told somebody &amp; moved on, I didnt hold it in for 28 years because it was just THAT traumatic.Your experience does not negate those of thousands of women in this country that tried to report their experiences and only got mocked and slut-shamed for it. I know plenty of guys who served in the military and didn't get PTSD; that doesn't mean that guys with actual PTSD are just overreacting.Getting PTSD from serving in the military &amp; having somebody squeeze your ass are two completely different things why are you even trying to compare them?They both can cause mental anguish and long-term trauma. You are severely downplaying the effect that sexual battery can have on individuals.I’ll be frank I think it’s bullshit that having your ass squeezed 28 years ago causes that much mental anguish. Pretty sure quite a few people would agree with me. Had she been raped or something like that then I certainly could see that. But making butt touch accusations on a dead man from 28 years ago? I call bullshit. She’s looking for a payday.First off, this is sexual battery, not assault. Completely different ball game.Secondly, she was allegedly groped on the buttox once. As scummy as that may be, its not traumatizing. If it was, society wouldn't be able to function as we'd all be falling over ourselves.Finally, you don't wait 28 years to report sexual battery. 28 years to report sexual assault or rape, different matter entirely and is much more understandible, thpuhh still murky.There is no evidence here, and won't be because of how long she allegedly waited. And Ellie Weisel isn't exactly a kingpin like Weinstein, so while being muted is a possibility, its highly unlikely &gt; First off, this is sexual battery, not assaultOh, well that makes it okay, doesn't it? Hey guys, it's all cool; it was sexual BATTERY, not sexual ASSAULT! Silly women...&gt; As scummy as that may be, its not traumatizing.It definitely can be. How many times have you been groped by someone who intended to fuck you regardless of your consent?&gt; Finally, you don't wait 28 years to report sexual batteryAs my cited source above shows: yes, you do. Whether battery or assault, it's scary and difficult to come forward about it. Especially when there are so many people like you who will try to downplay it and accuse the victim of overreacting to being sexually groped without her consent.&gt; There is no evidence here, and won't be because of how long she allegedly waited.That doesn't justify accusing her of overreacting to being sexually molested, or mean that her story shouldn't be heard.&gt; Oh, well that makes it okay, doesn't it?Did I say as much? No. Absolutely not. It's illegal for a reason.  Stop trolling.&gt; How many times have you been groped by someone who intended to fuck you regardless of your consent?A few times, but as I said, its not traumatizing. You don't see me getting flashbacks every time someone mentions groping.&gt; As my cited source above shows: yes, you do. Whether battery or assault, it's scary and difficult to come forward about it. Especially when there are so many people like you who will try to downplay it and accuse the victim of overreacting to being sexually groped without her consent.I think we're done here. We both agree that sexual batter, assault and rape is terrible, and should be investigated. I guess I'm backpedaling here, but there should be an investigation done. If there are no findings, then she should be under investigation in turn. That's how rule of law works. And if she's found not-guilty, then who am I to be shitty enough to accuse her otherwise? They already retracted the story. I was thinking Ted Kennedy.Bernie guy actually, but I do pretend to be a Trump supporter when talking to a Clintonite. Love how pissed off they get.I imagine Bernie would not appreciate your support. Automatically shaming a woman who cries, "rape" is a distinctly Trump thing to do.&gt; I imagine Bernie would not appreciate your support. Automatically shaming a woman who cries, "rape" is a distinctly Trump thing to do.There is so much wrong with this comment I can't even begin to break it down.This wasn't rape, Trump hasn't raped anyone, nobody is being shamed, and if you think a politician turns down supporters you clearly have no knowledge of politics.There are accusations that Trump raped someone, actually. At least two that I know of.As for turning down supporters, people have been quick to distance themselves from Weinstein, to the point of returning campaign contributions. Except if the women are named Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones or Kathleen Willey, only then it's a Clinton thing to do, am I right?only in your fantasy did  she cry "rape".you and your rape fantasies... smhIs it just me or is that just plain hilarious.And it's gone...... Editors are there to stop shit like this happening.This is sad. The book *Night* had a very profound influence on my understanding of the atrocities that occurred in war torn Europe.Story was retracted. Edit wordsNight Dawn and Day. Excellent series. 2017 is becoming the year of *Hey, I just Remembered it Happened to Me Too*I was sexually assaulted by this article!I wonder if this is that fake news we keep hearing so much about? It's so hard to tell these days. Was there any merit to the story, from anyone who happened to read it prior to getting taken down?The article was removed for not meeting journalistic standards. The guy who made that anti-free speech quote LSCers love to use?Keep coming out against these people, if you have proof then even better.He died a year ago, and there is no proof. She could literally say he dragged her into a bathroom and assaulted her and there is no way to argue it didn't happen.It happened or it didn't, but there is no way to verify.[deleted]My grandmother survived Auschwitz as a teenager but did not have a tattoo.  Other things she didn't have after the Holocaust: (most of her) siblings, parents, cousins, a house, etc.  You Nazis get so cute when you try to frame people with bullshitTo try to spear Elie Wiesel is an especially heinous. I wouldn't be surprised if a bit of antisemitism isn't involved with this.  Without out rock solid evidence, I won't ever consider this. There are very few books that ever made me cry. Night by Elie WieselThe Hiding Place by Corrie ten BoomDua Weapon of the Believers by Abu Ammaar Yasirare few of the only book that that made me tear up. &gt; I wouldn't be surprised if a bit of antisemitism isn't involved with this.Doubt it, think the accuser is Jewish too.I hadn't thought about this until this moment and looked up Singer and Toback. A lot of Jewish guysvetting called out.Weinstein, too. I think it's because a lot of Jewish people have positions of power in Hollywood, I don't think it's anything particular to them as a culture.I'm having a hard time telling if we've finally discovered the "rape culture" America supposedly has or if some/a lot of these are more false flags. Unfortunate, but doesn't surprise me.This is where you try to recruit people with holocaust denial shit isn't it?No. But I question the official narrative. I've read the majority of people do not believe the 9/11 official narrative, or the JFK official report. Why is it, that when there are other beliefs to particular subjects, people take such great offense to? As if one thing is so holy it can never be covered up or skewed for political reasons?&gt; But I question the official narrative.Ah, the call of the conspiracy theorist.  Beautiful and stupid at the same time.I do really like that all of the conspiracy nuts seem to have latched onto the conservative sphere.There was a conspiracy. Most big events in history are surrounded by conspiracies. Do you believe all official narratives on everything, yes or no?Why is that?His behavior throughout his life. He's not someone that I'd look at to hear this, and be shocked over.What behavior indicates sexual assault shouldn't b shocking?Inscrutable, devious behavior.. cultivating an entire career and life over embellishments. Not the sexual assault claim itself, but the character of the accused.Let me guess, you like to think of yourself as questioning the holocaust?There are obvious events surrounding that time period that make me ask questions. Do you question 9/11, or other dubious events within history that have substantial proof of a coverup or a misconception? I ask questions.  I don't ask questions from a bogus position of "substantial proof of a coverup".Of course you do. It's not bogus at all, If you did ask real questions then why don't you investigate all sides of a particular subject or event within history? Why be selective and only look at approved narratives?Let’s ignore the countless witness testimony, what the Nazis themselves claim they did, primary source documents from the Einstazgruppen, and the countless still standing death and concentration camps. Heck let’s also ignore the primary documents from the Wansee Confrence as well as the concrete fact that the pre-War Jewish population of Europe is completely gone. And that’s not to mention the millions of others killed by the Nazis. So some real evidence would be nice from the likes of you. It is bogus to claim there is substantial proof of coverup.Well bogus and/or dick in the toaster stupid.[deleted]Let me put this as elegantly and concisely as possible in an attempt to foresetall mine or anyone else attempting to debate someone who is clearly purposefully ignoring historical record: Fuck You. Truths can be told, but a fact is a fact. I can go over the empirical evidence, the data, and the record with in you PM if you'd like. Also, your vulgar language is inappropriate.Can you provide a specific example with proof? No? Then fuck offYes, send me a PM. Also - That language isn't appropriate to the conversation we're having.No. Provide us proof in this thread. But you don't have any, do you? The Holocaust card has been played. Game over.oh man, someone brought up the Holocaust when discussing a guy famous for being a Holocaust survivor. what a surprise  Oh shit, this is the first I'm hearing about this. What did he embellish? A 25 year old didn't have dates correct from traumatic experiences when he was 15 so this guy thinks the holocaust was fake.That's a fair point, I don't remember dates for shit. Add starvation, abuse, etc then not talking about it for 10 yearsJust ignore him. He's a Holocaust denier.His accounts of being a prisoner of war, compared with contemporary accounts. Doctored photos, timelines not adding up. How much he's profited off it. Most people would suffer PTSD from it, not go around their whole lives making millions off it.Most people probably did suffer PTSD.  You are pointing to one among millions, whom you selected on the basis of his having dealt with it differently than you might have expected.  This is an obvious selection bias.  Moreover, suffering PTSD and "making millions" off it are not mutually exclusive. Not. I've seen the photographs, many of which were doctored compared to the original photographs. I've seen the evidence and gone over the accounts. This is how I've formulated my beliefs.This is mind boggling to me. I've never considered that he might not be what he claimed. Don't become a Holocaust denier just because you read an unsourced comment from some anonymous idiot on Reddit.[Second from bottom row, seventh person from the left. That's Elie Weisel at Buchenwald.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Buchenwald_Slave_Laborers_Liberation.jpg/1280px-Buchenwald_Slave_Laborers_Liberation.jpg)Oh god no. Even if the man in question was a con artist of some sort, I'd never assume a greater conspiracy. You really might want to look at a different source than this guy before you make that judgment.
This isn't the "murder trial of Kate Steinle."  Kate Steinle is dead and didn't murder anyone so she isn't on trial for murder.  This is the murder trial of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate.  Why would someone write a headline like this?I understand wanting to get the victim name in the headline, because it usually means more than the suspect unless the accused is, like, OJ Simpson or something.  But it’s shitty writing to do it this way.  How ‘bout “trial for murder of Kate Steinle” if you’re really pinched for character count (although why would you be, online” Or be really coherent and go with “murder trial begins for immigrant accused of killing Kate Steinle”Local news.  It seems they always write like this.&gt; Jose Ines Garcia Zarate&gt; Why would someone write a headline like this?You answered your own question. I think he was a ‘white hispanic’ though...I don't think his race matters....? The he was hear illegally that's all anyone cares about. THANK YOU.  That just leapt off the screen at me.  Because uneducated pricks are writing these stories and mucking up the factsEditors choose headlines, not writers.Like these websites hire editors...Regardless, a barristor (lawyer) told me that so far, every major case he has ever been in has been reported either falsely to gain more views or so poorly written that the story itself was warped to seem completely different 🤷🏻‍♂️I hate it when I'm walking in public with stolen firearms wrapped in clothes that just happen to fall out and shoot people.It didn't fall out and go off.  He fired the gun 3 times."He was cleaning it when it malfunctioned"He didn't steal it, he found it behind a bench. He claims it was wrapped in a shirt, so if true, he wouldn't necessarily know it was a gun until he picked it up. The gun was stolen by someone else, from a car, where it was left by a BLM ranger. And he just happened to find the gun and fire it three times at this woman. "No your honor, I didn't steal that gun that was stolen.""Yes, you should totally believe me your honor, I have a great track record for telling the truth and following the law, you can see evidence of this by the fact that I have entered this country illegally 6 times."Edited, thanks for the clarificationBut where did he get it? This guy was dirt poor, and then you need to buy bullets for the firearm.&gt; But Zarate said the shooting was accidental. He said he was handling a handgun he found wrapped in a T-shirt under a bench on the pier when it accidentally fired. The handgun belonged to a Bureau of Land Management ranger who reported that it was stolen from his parked car in San Francisco a week before Steinle was shot.Ah yes, the old "I illegally came into the country multiple times, just happened to find a stolen handgun, and it went off accidentally, killing a person" defense. Guess he had to come up with something. It went off 'accidentally' 3 times at that.I don’t see why in instances like this the family isn’t able to sue the hell out of the local/state/federal government. Women is dead because of political agendas and an nationwide desire to not pay Americans a decent wage that creates a second class worker to exploit. Lol wut?Do you know what [standing](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/standing) is? Also, have you heard of [sovereign immunity?](https://jonesdevoy.com/tag/sovereign-immunity/)But if anyone should be sued it should be the SF PD:&gt; So U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which had Lopez-Sanchez in its custody in March after his release from federal prison, turned him over to San Francisco deputies. ICE said they requested an immigration detainer, asking that the agency be notified before Lopez-Sanchez was released.&gt; But San Francisco is a city that doesn't honor such requests and the sheriff's department released him. Freya Horne, chief legal counsel to the San Francisco County Sheriff, told CNN that he was let go because there was no legal cause to detain the suspect. http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/03/us/san-francisco-killing-suspect-immigrant-deported/index.html___A woman is dead, because a man who was deported **5 fucking times** was let go by the SF PD, and stole a firearm. A woman is dead because California's state government love illegal immigrants and sanctuary city policies.I always got a kick out of people defending sanctuary cities. They always say something along the lines of it being a better opportunity for the person here illegals.it's not about opportunities for these people. It's about making sure high income households and construction businesses can find cheap landscapers and workers to do all the manual labor americans suddenly think we're "too good." to do.If the fed were serious about stoppinhg illegal immigration, then they would go after the companies that employ them. That'd put a huge dent in illegal immigration pretty quickly.Better than people defending the right to have their gun stolen.I don't know anyone who is defending the right to have their firearms stolen. That's seems... Incorrect.&gt; Women is dead because of political agendas and an nationwide desire to not pay Americans a decent wage that creates a second class worker to exploit. I am sorry, but when some people are deported and they keep on coming back "exploitation" is the wrong term. Illegals aren't some retarded rats that keep on sucking on the cocaine despite being shocked. Obviously it is advantageous to them to come. They, for the most part, willingly choose to come here. They benefit economically by coming here. as to your other point, it isn't that simplistic about nationwide desire to not pay a decent wage. You have to add on a nationwide desire for cheap prices. It is easy for you to say: "yeah, pay farm workers $30 bucks an hour to pick fruit." but if you are barely scraping buy, do you want to pay 10-20% more for your food? If you are on a fixed income, do the increased prices benefit you? These are simplistic scenarios, and illegals do much more than picking fruit. But I guarantee the same people complaining about illegals are going to be complaining about not affording things as prices rise when producers attempt to recoup the lost savings from the consumer.Exploitation doesn’t necessarily mean both sides don’t benefit. Before child labor laws you can’t say that children and their families didn’t “benefit” from going and working. If it was sell your 12 year old body on the street or become a pickpocket, would you choose the 10 hour work day in 1842?Well that’s what I’m saying. Someone can exploit you and it could still be your best option. They are just taking advantage of your situation. &gt; They are just taking advantage of your situation. so the best option is to pass on higher prices to the majority of Americans so that a few people that work in an industry have jobs?Sounds like something a slave owner in 1830 would say “without these slaves the price of cotton is just gonna be too high” and also why can’t you apply that to any industry “we should give the auto industry an exemption from min wage laws so we can compete with South Korea and the textile industry an exemption for clothes” Why are you against Americans getting a fair wage? &gt; Sounds like something a slave owner in 1830 wouldYes, because an immigrant that decides to come to the US to work and can leave at any time with no repercussions is exactly comparable to a slave. &gt; Why are you against Americans getting a fair wage? Have you met any illegal immigrants? I know several and they aren't getting paid pennies on the dollar. In many cases they are getting paid above minimum wage. It is long-standing myth that illegals are getting paid below minimum wage and accepting scraps. &gt; Why are you against Americans getting a fair wage? Are you going to help me absorb the higher of price of goods and services I use when companies pass the cost increase to me?But your argument for lower costs at all disregard could be applied to anything. Slavery, child labor, conflict diamonds, etc. is that really the hill you want to die on. “I don’t give a shit as long as my strawberries are cheap” ? &gt; . Slavery, child labor, conflict diamonds, how is deciding to come to the US to work illegally equivalent to slave, child labor or conflict diamonds? &gt; Before child labor laws you can’t say that children and their families didn’t “benefit” from going and working. there is a major difference between a school-aged child and a working-age adult. Children were very frequently hired on with their parent in industrial era UK/US.are we living in the industrial era? An adult that willingly traverses hundreds of miles to come to the US to work, receive a wage much higher than in their home country and provide for their family much better than they can in their home country, is not the same as a child who has absolutely no choice in the matter. Perhaps that was a bad example. Just because you can do something but it hurts workers who are citizens by importing cheap labor who undercut their value should you? As a government do you serve your citizens or is your first priority having the cheapest fruit as possible? if the government were interested in serving citizens they would eliminate all subsidies for food and allow them to purchase goods at the lowest price possible so that they have money for other things.So the best government is no government? Do some reading on legal causation and proximate cause.[deleted]Still think they have some liability. Just because it’s a liberal city and don’t care about it’s citizens, other agencies should still have some responsibility to them. [deleted]I agree, most laws are created by the government who hates their citizens. They aren’t going to be particularly beneficial to the citizens, the government believes they only exist for tax revenue. Another disgusting sanctuary city. Good job SF, you care more about illegals than your own taxpaying citizens. I would be interested to find out where this guy got a gun. From what I understand he was homeless without any money. Not many homeless can afford a gun and then buy bullets for the gun.Wrong place, wrong time.In this case the wrong place being the United States of America.More like a sanctuary city in the US.Great. Trumptards are going to get their 2nd wind on ths.Yes, that's the tragedy. People you hate because they disagree with you have been shown to be correct. Tumptards? Any decent American should be upset at what San Francisco did here. "Oh no, this article will make people think that some illegal immigrants commit crimes!" Is that what you meant? Are you more concerned with political optics than with a woman who was murdered?
That black smoke is so ominous.  I hope everyone gets out in time and they're able to contain it quickly and decisivelyWhat is Burning? someone said Dupont used this for storage? christ I wouldnt want to be down wind of thishope everyone gets upwind if they can I hear it gets ya fucked if you breath it in."Who needs the EPA?!?""Thank god the war on coal is over."Yeah. Without the EPA, who would poison the rivers?[removed]I get the feeling you don't get the reference.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/13/epa-wont-pay-claims-mine-spill-released-3m-gallons-toxic-water/96555846/I live really close to it, a couple miles, and the smoke is going right by my house. I also drove by the fire about an hour-2 hours after it started and it was massive. Had no idea exactly what building was burning initially.Sorry about your future of perpetual sickness :(A toilet paper factory burnt down a few miles from where I live a few years ago, and it snowed burned toilet paper like a scene from Silent Hill.I hope you are in a safe area, if the smoke is reaching your area I would evacuate as soon as possible, as of right now I think the environmental agency hasn’t gotten the speciation of the sample yet, so nobody knows how harmful it is. Does anybody knows what company is it? If we can get that information then we can check their SDSs and see what harmful chemicals are present, this should be public. Regardless of what is burning, dense smoke will be very harmful.The chemicals in the fire were publicly released, there were some pretty bad ones. I'll post the link in this comment when I get the chance but evacuation isn't much of an option. My work place is in Parkersburg, my home is in Parkersburg... And given the past pollution problems that the government was so hesitant to tell the truth about, I doubt we'll ever hear "evacuate" around here..I’m sorry to hear that, what are your options? Is shelter in place going on? Or nothing so far? Unfortunately this is your chance to advocate and make yours and your neighbors voice to be heard. Like I have said in other posts this isn’t a blue/red problem, this is everybody’s and we need to take action out health and future are at stake. Regulations are a necessity to ensure the future of our existence (talking from the environmental perspective).You’ll never know with this administration eitherHello fellow West Virginian. I live in Beckley.Maybe a truckload of marshmallows and graham crackers will be delivered by the EPA and turn this into a positive story about the locals enjoying s'mores and free heat.  What about the Hershey bars?What about the Hershey bars?Typical liberal hit job on a small business just trying to turn a profit so it can hire more ex-coal miners.It's almost as if liberals want businesses to fail just to benefit their precious 'environment'.^^^/sWait, what? How are you coming to this conclusion?He's being sarcastic.ohhhhhhhh. I just noticed the tiniest of /s's. Got me good. You really can't tell these days.Satire? Serious? Russian Troll? 4chan troll?  **Satire, Serious, Russian Troll, 4chan Troll, or Trump**Sounds like that could make for an interesting drinking game.Take a shot if it's satire, drink an entire handle if it's the other 4.     Quickest way to get absolutely wasted and forget the hell we got ourselves in.I really want to play that game, but somebody has to be the Dungeon Master.Saterioussian 4chan troll? Or even worse, a samsquanchGot damn Samsquanch! I gotta put up with their bullshit in the woods enough as it is!In the mean time the EPA is beefing up security measures adding more agents and a soundproof room after rise in death threats. Less regulations, more security, “regulations are killing the economy guys”.Looks like we got ourselves a new site for Silent Hill.They're not trying to use any of those job-killing regulations to get the fire put out, are they?Random thought: The actual text of the Second Amendment seems to suggest that regulation is a good thing... Damn liberals and their liberal Second Amendment.Any chance the pollution will reach Pittsburgh?Like I always say during forest fires, where the hell are the fire planes!. Just seems like a bunch of them doing one drop after another would take care of this stuff. According to the CEO of one of the air tanker companies says the forest service is to blame. Says he has no idea why they sabotage their efforts.   No toxicity here. Just ask the EPA.So the entire state is on fire? What a shame.
I don't know who this guy is at all but what the fuck is this:&gt; Terri Conn was 23 and acting on the soap opera “As the World Turns” when, according to her, Toback approached her on the street. Wanting to act in an edgy independent film, Conn agreed to meet with Toback in Central Park to discuss his process. Once there, Conn reports that Toback told her the best way to get to know someone is to see their soul, which is best achieved by looking into their eyes while experiencing orgasm. At that point, Conn said he knelt down in front of her and began humping her leg while staring into her eyes.&gt; “I was shocked and frozen and didn’t know what to do,” Conn said. “I thought if I resisted, it could get worse. He could overpower me.” He quickly ejaculated into his khakis, got up and asked her to meet for dinner later to continue the process.Is Toback a small dog wearing dog trousers?I'm naming my next small dog 'Khaki'. Don't ejaculate into your dog.Lmfao what the fuck, and he did this in public???What part of the D.E.N.N.I.S system was that from?He's Demonstrating His Value. Few women get to truly see a man's soul. Nah, she knew his value. that's why she met him in the park. He was engaging her physically.You are corrext. This is textbook Engage Physically.[removed]Ugh..... Name checks out.How on earth can one get off into khakis from dry humping?  That just seems like so much...chafing?Still creepy as fuck, but Jesus, the more I read these stories, the more I realize how normal and sane I am.TIL my neighbors’ schnauzer is James Toback.That’s so fucked I almost downvoted it but came back to my sensesOh god it's the implication&gt;During these meetings, many of the women said, Toback boasted of sexual conquests with the famous and then asked humiliating personal questions. How often do you masturbate? How much pubic hair do you have? He’d tell them, they said, that he couldn’t properly function unless he “jerked off” several times a day. And then he’d dry-hump them or masturbate in front of them, ejaculating into his pants or onto their bodies and then walk away. Meeting over.Someone needs to tell this guy that pornhub is not a documentary. Is this guy a dog? Dry humping and ejaculating on legs?Well, considering his actions were likely more about exerting power and dominance than actual sex... I'd say yes? &gt; pornhub is not a documentaryFuck.Cancelling my pizza-delivery gig.Was so stoked to start tomorrow night.Who the fuck is James Toback?&gt; James TobackHe did:  * Fingers  * Love and Money  * Exposed  * The Pick-up Artist  * The Big Bang  * Two Girls and a Guy   If only we had some prior indications. If only.I honestly haven't heard of any of these movies.Nobody has.but they're provocative, gets the people goingball so hardMo'fuckas wanna fine meThat shit craywhat she order? Fish filet That shit cray. That shit cray.Creme bruleeChick-fil-aThis is the quality content I signed up for.Wanna fine* meThis changes everythingHaha honestly I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone use it correctly Even as a cinema buff, provocative typically means "bad" in the same way that gore horror movies are lazy.I'm kinda glad these creeps are getting bulldozed by their past sexual harassment. Hopefully they get replace by actually talented people with an honestly competent perspective and vision. Plus predators getting burned is funny. Considered myself a movie buff, aka seen a lot of movies...until I read that list.I'm a movie buff and I've only seen The Pick-up Artist because it aired on Comedy Central pretty regularly in the 90s.Hey, don't beat yourself up. I don't think his personal home videos countIn two girls and a guy, Robert Downey eats out Heather grahams ass while she's standing and he's kneeling down behind her.I'm intrigued but rather worried about what the second girl is doing.Look, as long as there's no cup involved...RDJ *is* the cupWell from the news headline I'm guessing the second girl was doing James Toback, not by choice however...Eating Robert Downey's ass...and then they buy a pizza place? Ok you have to link. I googled "the pickup artist heather graham sex scene" and a bunch of news came up saying Weinstein implied they had sex... but no good stuffThat’s because you googled the wrong movie...https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=1181298638Derp. Why tf did I Google pickup artistI only know him from his documentaries. 'Tyson' (2008 Mike Tyson doc) was very good. 'Seduced &amp; Abandoned' was interesting - about Toback and Alec Baldwin at the Canne Film Festival pitching their film to anyone that will listen.    They all sound like soft-core titles.I've watched a few movies about 2 girls and a guy.That's some pretty awfully written foreshadowing.Why do these oddly sound like the name of pornos?It's like Anthony Weiner.Honestly this kind of shit is the only thing that makes me think there could be some sort of cosmic plan. It's like we are in book and the author wanted to ironically foreshadow.Lots of people’s names could easily be used to describe some aspect of their lives.This new simulation is trash.Question still stands. That fedora is also a red flag. He looks like the patron saint of neckbeards My insides.  They hurt.Stop, you're drinking `Insides Hurting Juice`!Oof owie ouchMy insidesDylan Tobacks dad? The big deal, sir, is that a grown man shushed me and my friend here.God, I hate gin!Dee you bitch!Our sign is down. It's never BEEN down, you see what I'm saying?He had Almond eyes and he was a shuusher!Don't compliment the man.Stop complimenting his eyes!I'm not complimenting I hate almond eyesAll these people remember him for the shushing and totally forget the fact that he raped a guy too. He barely made it in, but it's technically still rape.Charlie shook him off in time but he got into Dennis for a bit, he just wanted Dennis more.Rude man who shushes, uhhhh, please call.Hello this "shhhhh""Oh goddamnit"I bet he's a shusher too!fuck i was wondering why the last name sounded so familiar... hahahaa guy who made 9 movies I had not heard about.Wrote~~/directed~~ Bugsy. (Nominated for Oscar.)Wrote yes directed no.  That was Barry Levinson[deleted]He’s a shush-erI hope this is the start of more women being comfortable enough to come forward about sexual harassment. These cockroaches need to be brought into the light. I think it's already happening.  It started with *one* report on Weinstein, like a week ago or so, I can't remember exactly.  Since that time, can you remember how many additional cases that are similar have come out?  A lot.  While it's sad to see his kind of shit going on, it's a wonderful thing to see people finally speaking up and out about it.  Their lives will no longer be governed by fear.  &gt; It started with one report on WeinsteinTo be fair, that report had his personnel file leaked to them and did a massive write up of him. ...and written by Ronan FarrowFYI for those who don't know he is Woody Allen and Mia Farrow's son. He's also had an impressive career so far apart from the Weinstien piece.Certainly worth a [read](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronan_Farrow)He graduated Yale *law school* at 21. That is crazy. Removing childhood makes life speed up significantly.  Ronan Farrow was privately tutored and sheltered from the world.  You can get through high school by 15 if you don't do anything else with your life.  Yep, most of us don't have the financial means to get a kickstart on life. Still, good on the guy. At least he seems to be doing something useful with his life.I thought he was Frank Sinatras son? Where tf did I hear that?Look at a picture of Ronan, then Woody Allen, then Sinatra and finally back to Ronan.Its pretty fucking obvious than Frank Sinatra is Ronans father...Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's sonBut add Mia Farrow in there, and he just looks like the spitting image of her. Anyone could be his father.It was a rumor for a long time, but his mother stated that it's possible in 2013. Basically no one knows for sure, because no paternity test has been done or made public.The report in the *Times* came out first. Farrow had been working on his piece for the *New Yorker* for a long time, and I guess it was rushed to print a few days later after the *Times* beat him to it.I'm just in my small corner of Canada (Quebec) and many cases have come out since, that you (mostly American) guys would never hear about because you've never heard of these Quebec showbiz celebrities.  I don't know how it is in Europe and elsewhere but it definitely started a movement.In Britain we've recently had many people come forward after Jimmy Saville died to say they were abused by him. He was a BBC presenter and DJ and used his position and status to get into hospitals and children's homes to abuse people. It was reported for years but the BBC covered it up for their own benefit.In Denmark people allso startet to tell about theres cases. From years old to today.Same in Sweden. Several celebrities who have been outed here. I think a big factor is that women feel a lot safer. It's hard to threaten to wreck someone's career over speaking out when everyone is speaking out. There's a shift in the power balance right now.  I think the most important part is the precedent it sets for the future. This is a lot less likely to happen now that it's out in the open.This guy already had an expose written about his sexual abuse in the late 80s and it changed nothing. Brother of Dylan Toback, the notorious "shusher." I see being a piece of shit runs in the family.Maybe Dylan was based on the real Toback? Scrolled through for the IASP commentsBryan singer. Bryan singer. Bryan singer.Everyday I'm waiting for that bomb to drop. Didn't it already drop in an empty field?It still amazes me that nothing has happened to that piece of shit. All that stuff comes out and not word, and he then gets to have a hand in every fucking Xmen movie/show. Fuck that guy with a cactus. I'm gonna regret asking, but can you tell me what I've missed? And why his name sounds familiar...Edit: a few people have told me what I missed, thanks. All the notifications with comments telling me he molests little boys is bringing down my day though D:He's a director known for The Usual Suspects and almost all of the Xmen movies. When Days of Future Past was in production a report came out that he was in a group that would basically molest young boys. I can't remember exactly what it was, but he was able to "disprove" it on a technicality. I think the accuser said it happened on a certain date in a certain state, but Singer wasn't in the town that date, but he was there around that date. Basically he got off because the accuser got the date wrong. Singer then went on to run a mini smear campaign against that person to get them silenced. He's as shitty as they come. Ah, so basically he suffered what most Hollywood exec victims probably fear if they speak out, got it.I hope the whole truth comes out on every single one of these slimy scumbags.Yeah, people always ask why no one speaks out against these assholes. That's why. It only hurts them more. Then there's that story Kate Beckinsale released about a male actor who tried to warn young actresses about Harvey Weinstein and he ended up getting blacklisted for it. So even being an ally to the victims would fuck you over. There was only so much someone could do.There's also the fact that California has some SERIOUS libel/slander laws so if you come forward as a victim, and don't have any real proof, you could be setting yourself up for not only an end to your acting career but also being sued by the very fucking person that you were already victimized by.Makes you wonder who was behind those laws in the first place...This actually makes it very very risky to report after the statute of limitations.Without the backing of a criminal investigation gathering evidence for you, putting together evidence is probably impossible.  You would be on your own to defend yourself in the libel case having to pay for investigators out of pocket.Of course, once you report it, if more people come forward, then you are protected by the numbers of people saying the same kind of thing.  But until those additional victims come forward, you are a sitting duck.It points to the need of a place people can secretly report this shit that links victims and puts together cases.  Only going public when enough victims come out that no one can deny the allegations.If you want to learn a bit more about Bryan Singer and this group, I would recommend giving the documentary "An Open Secret" a watch. I believe they made it available on YouTube to watch.It was directed by Amy Berg, who did "Deliver Us From Evil" about the Catholic Church. What's crazy is she had no problem taking on the Catholic Church, but seems to have completely disappeared off the face of the earth when this film came out, refusing to cooperate with the marketing campaign and distancing herself from the film. I guess this Hollywood group is more scary to her than the Catholic Church.http://deadline.com/2015/07/an-open-secret-documentary-film-amy-berg-1201487697/Edit: found the documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKTDqqLoVf0The rumours didn't start with his X-Men movies, but with his second film Apt Pupil. Article fropm 1997: http://ew.com/article/1997/05/02/indecent-proposal-set-apt-pupil/And that group of guys started a web streaming service where they produced short films.  The plot was always that a 15 year old boy got to Hollywood and lived with older guys in a mansion and played pool and hung out in the Jacuzzi.  Yep, nothing molesty about that at all.  No reason to think the boys they cast in those roles were not treated with complete professionalism.  The guy who came forward was in one of those movies.  He must be lying.  There is no way a group of gay men known for keeping twinks would possibly have molested that kid.  No way in hell.  Imagine if they suppiled those teens with all sorts of drugs...  Glad that never happened.He's the director of most of the main series X-Men films. Over the last 10 years he's been accused of molestation by 2 separate underage boys. Whether it's true or not who knows,  but it became big new for like a day when X-men Days of Futures past came out and then was quickly forgotten.Bryan Singer has been involved with all Xmen movies/shows as well with Usual Suspects, Superman Returns. Supposed he likes young boys/men, and has 2 people who basically work for him bringing young people from all over Hollywood. Hosts tons of parties at his place. Along with this, uses his social status to promise people stardom in exchange for stuff or relationships.  One of the people who supposed launched off him was in Twilight series. The case he was accused of I believed to be a young man woke up to Singer, and few other older men molesting him.  ... Likes raping young boys. dude sill has projects in the works. ***Forget it Jake, It's Hollywoo.***Thoughts and prayersIt's coming. Somebody with a lot of downvotes above said *"A LOT of these women are professional gold diggers"*, to which I say:  Really?  James Toback is the best that thirty eight female entertainment industry professionals could come up with?  James Toback in consensus and virtually overnight, with allegations spanning decades of predatory behavior?One is a freak incident, two is coincidence, three is a pattern.  If industry predators today are feeling extremely vulnerable and can't sleep at night, if they feel the possibility of going from "untouchable" to being outed and blacklisted as very near and closing in, if their hypertension is acting up due to fear and suddenly feeling that they've lost control for the first time in a long time and they've forgotten what that feels like, the sensation of anxiety bordering on panic, **GOOD**.These sociopaths probably won't lose their wealth, but they will have lost all the respect they have so carefully crafted over the years, they will be powerless even as they thought they'd never feel like that again, surely their marriages will splinter into pieces also.  The very real possibility of becoming a pariah.  You know, I hate *schadenfreude* and there is certainly an element of that, but it's more along the lines of justice, of chickens coming home to roost as they undergo a professional and social death, too little too late maybe after all the harm they've done, but it's infinitely better than nothing happening, business as usual and continuing to act with impunity with no fear of repercussions.^^EDIT:  ^^TypoPLEASE let's keep this trend going. I will not complain at all if celebrity after celebrity uses their award speeches to take about this issue. It needs to be repeated over and over and over and driven into the ground or else people will forget and get weak and in two years time, it will be business as usual. He looks like an absolute knobFedora? Check.Shitty dress jacket over jeans? Check.Thin moustache/beard combo? Check.Yup, that guy definitely m'ladies.u forgot the ponytailhugh hefner probably died at the right time*edit*: sorry, i didn't mean for this to be the top comment.  let's not take away from the fact that james toback is (allegedly) a terrible human being and hopefully he is not able to prey on any more womenI expect a lot of dirt on him in the future. There were a lot of rumours from ex mansion lurkers. There's about 6 feet of dirt on him already Which is a lot, to be fairOne of Hefner's best friends was Bill Cosby. One of Cosby's victims was told to shut her mouth because of this fact. The Playboy Playmate Cynthia Myers said she personally witnessed Cosby drugging various women at the Mansion. This makes Hefner an enabler at best.Holly Madison wrote in her memoir that Hefner made her and the other Bunnies take drugs that were so-called "thigh openers", IIRC.Peter Bogdanovich in his book, *The Killing of the Unicorn*, about his then-recently murdered GF and Playmate Dorothy Stratten, alleged that Hefner raped Stratten. I don't know if Bogdanovich still stands by those claims (book was written in '81 and I don't believe he's said anything about it since). I bet he knewHe’s not suggesting Hefner didn’t know...he’s suggesting Hefner was a harasser as well and died before accusations could surface.Didnt stop that one chick for saying something about Swayze and hes been dead for 10+ years.What? Patrick Swayze is dead?2009, so not quite 10 years. CancerWell, TIL. Dead men pay no debts, dead men serve no time.yeah, i feel like someone in his position a. knows basically everything going on in hollywood and b. doesnt care enough to try to stop it.Thats the because those men who did the harassment were probably the same men who show up at Hughs partiesHonestly I thought Hugh Hefner was just notorious for his... Womanizing?I mean the dude was always walking around in Pjs with two playmates on his arms.  In Fresh Prince Of Bel Air, he made an appearance where he said he was proud of his wife's success as a playmate...Like I don't know that much about the guy, and I'm not trying to dishonor his memory, but I think it's safe to say that he enjoyed what he did.  The difference in my mind between the Hef and someone like Weinstein is that Hef was very open about his "bedroom life".  I see him as someone that just opened doors for women, but he let them decide if they wanted to walk through.  Weinstein was forcing them through with intimidation and what not? Keep ‘em coming. Out them all. Fuck every single one of these guys. this is just the tip of iceberg , tons more are shitting their pants thinking they are nextI hope they're terrified. I hope the fear is paralyzing. Its amazing how things changed over the years. In the 80's and 90's women actresses were shamed for claiming harassment or assault. Then it turns out Hollywood has all these predators.The Korean music and film industry underwent a similar change not too long ago when it turned out a lot of music industry and film industry execs were taking advantage of their power to affect the careers of starlets by strongly encouraging them to have sex in exchange for potential career support or else face retribution.I feel like Korea still kinda does it tbh, but it's improved a lot and that change is still happening today. While I’m not doubting they were harassed or assaulted in the 80’s, the culture of shaming them led to an increased comfortability for sexual predators like Weinstein and Toback because they knew either A) an actress wouldn’t damage their career by coming forward, and B) if they did come forward, no one would believe them. This is why rape accusations need to be always be taken seriously, for male and female abuse, because the consequences of brushing off these accusations creates and encourages these toxic cultures we see in Hollywood, the Catholic Church, Mormonism, Amish communities... there’s always a long path of ignored injustices that lead up to these cultures.Remember when more than 15 women came forward about Trump and no one gave a shit? Yeah, this world doesn't make sense right now. It's almost like humanity on the whole is actually kinda despicable.And we don't know that his supporters aren't sitting at home, watching and reading this, thinking, "Well, yeah, those are the perks of the job," and, "A man has needs," and, "It was a different time."Oh man. Theyre doing way more than that. T_d jumped all over weinstein and "liberal Hollywood that supported him." The irony is almost too much to handleWhat is worse is during his campaign they said Bill Clinton rode on the lolito express to demonize Hillary when we have records of Trump riding the same airline around the same time. It's only bad if your enemy is doing it!Confirmation bias. Most ordinary people did not identify themselves as "Harvey Weinstein supporters" before that New York Times article came out. There was nothing about Harvey Weinstein's crimes that made people question their identity. For the people who support Trump, it's more likely to be integral to who they are and more difficult to change their minds beyond the conclusions they have already drawn about him.SERIOUSLY. If I read one more "more women should come out about this" comment, I'm going to throw something. Women HAVE come out about this on the regular and nobody did shit. Women pointed to a presidential candidate and told stories of assault and harassment and people said "locker room talk" or "liar."Not to mention the rest of this thread which seems convinced that this is strictly a Hollywood problem. Wake the fuck up. This has happened to every woman I know, including myself. If you don't see the problem, you're probably part of it.If celebrities could stop trying to rape people, that'd be pretty cool.I think this is a great example of the butterfly effect. That one Hannible Burrus joke, that brought up all of the assualts Bill Cosby committed, seems to have led to a vast increase in the number of women coming forward. Predators who have thrived for decades are being exposed. Its highly likely that some women in the future that would have otherwise been assaulted no longer will be due to more of these predators being caught. Its a revolution for preventing and prosecution of those who commit sexual assault. The world will become a better place, and it all started with a joke. People may study this phenomenon, the rise in statistics it may lead to, and how it all started for years. And we are only at the start. This will probable get buried, but whoever reads this thank you for reading my analysis and have a great day. Tldr:A Hannible Burrus Joke, may lead to a potentially historic change in how sexual assault is perceived and prosecuted.Not a big deal or anything, but it’s spelled Hannibal Buress Note to self:  Don't work in HollywoodShould have been working in the UK instead. You'd have had the chance to work with such stars as Rolf Harris, Jimmy Savile, Gary Glitter, Dave Lee Travis, Max Clifford, Fred Talbot, Ian Watkins, Chris Langham, etc, etc...Fuck Ian Watkins the 1 yo molesting fucker ,I hope he does in prison tbhThis doesn't just happen in Hollywood.http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/21/media/bill-oreilly-32-million-settlement/index.htmlAnd Roger Ailes tooAnd Eric Bolling.TBH, Fox News is just hollywood for ugly people. I wonder how it's like in the porn industry It's actually really fucking awful. The actors will say "Well I'm not doing this" and then get forced into doing it anyway. Look up "James Deen"They're signing up for sex,  but it's the assault that they're not signing up for. Read a few stories about the abuse that's going on. One woman was slapped so hard, her jaw was broken. Side note: trafficked women in porn movies are raped. Bryan Singer (director) was accused of sexually assault against a 17 year old in 1999. Still directing movies. I think it's great that this culture change/shift is happening.  It's been going on for decades and it needed to change.  Sexual assault, abuse and harassment is nothing to joke about when it can and does affect people.  And yes, men and women can inflict it on others.I'm a little more cynical I guess. Our culture seems wildly inconsistent with how it treats aggressive advances by people in power. Everyone gets on board when it's an easy target: someone unlikeable, ugly, or past their prime.What if this was actually someone popular? Would the media dare go after them? Would the public defender them and attack their accusers?There was a couple episodes of Opie and Anthony on how James toback creepily picked up Opies wife.Toback is a ghoul.Hollywood really needs a reboot.Hollywood pt.2 Rape free electric boogalooWhy are all the harassers fat and uglyUnattractive women who make claims of sexual assault or rape are often not believed because many people erroneously associate rape with sexual desire, and say, "Oh yeah, right, who wants rape *that*?" I've actually seen that comment on Reddit on news articles about sexual assault. Similarly, when attractive men are accused of sexual assault, people are less likely to take it seriously, thinking, "Why would he have to go after anyone, he could get any woman he wanted," and immediately discount the victim. The story is the same with the any gender, really. People associate so much of this stuff with sexual attraction or desire when in most cases it's about power and degradation. This was Trump's defense for all the women accusing him of assault and harassment.  He said it was impossible because he found them all unattractive.Before Trump decided that he hated the Clintons, he came to Bill Clinton's defense in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and stated that the only problem he had with it was that Monica was a fatso and that Bill should have had better standards in molesting interns.Trump said this about one of the women he sexually assaulted&gt;    “I've actually seen that comment on Reddit on news articles about sexual assault.”That comment has literally been made by our current President. Literally realized this last night and it blew my mind. I'd say it's an extension of the whole "attractive people are well liked" thing. so you can feel better about yourself on more than one level[Amy Schumer named this guy 3 years ago.](https://twitter.com/amyschumer/status/470440182312079363) Glad this is finally coming (more) forward.The first line of his IMDb bio starts thus:&gt; James Toback, highly respected as a screenwriter and the director of nine films, ...Highly respected, eh? What are the odds he wrote his own IMDb page? I've personally never heard of him before this, and looking at his films I think I recall seeing an ad for "Tyson" one time and that's it. This is Hollywood's version of Bernie Madoff.  This is their patsy, someone who nobody will miss, but somebody who is a big enough name to matter.  It wasn't the sexual assaults that ultimately did him in, it was the fact that he no longer makes enough money for the industry. We know there are probably some huge fucking names connected with many extremely popular films and they will stay hidden and protected, because ya know, sequels, prequels, reboots, and name brands.  I dunno. Does it get bigger than Weinstein?Holy shit! This guy is Weinstein on speed! actually [over 50 women](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/20/16507624/lupita-nyongo-harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment) have come out with allegations against Weinstein so far :( truly horrible. I think that we may be seeing a real cultural shift here, and hope that every asshole abusing their power to prey on people like this is brought down by it. Love it keep naming names ladies
She's got the crazy eyes.People's physical feature don't indicate or incriminate. She might have crazy eyes. Millions of people have crazy eyes. Doesn't mean they are all sexual predators. Judge her for her conduct. Not for her physical features. Shut up, we are busy judging others &gt; *She's got the crazy eyes.*But imagine walking into her classroom afterwards.Oh... the AROMA!!!What the fuckI believe it's called incelism.Oh, you seem to be lost. /r/incels is over that way -----&gt;The aroma of BO? No thanks! She was my teacher back in 2013, probably one of the best teachers at my school. But she always had a few favorite girls in the class that shed always hang out with after school ended. It was pretty annoying when I would need to see her after school to get help with a project and the favorite was ALWAYS there. I guess we'll wait and see if further accusations come out.Did she drive a Subaru?Why because she is a lesbian?No, just wondering if she values structurally sound cars with AWD and a great price.I had an Outback from 2011 til this year, I also do a lot of yardwork and house renovations, wear flannel shirts and eat pussy.  The stereotype has to come from somewhere. Somehow this mildly turned me on.  I must re-assess my priorities.  Follow your heart famI googled it once, Subaru started targeted marketing towards the LGBT demographic years ago. Smart move on their part, might not be a mass market, but it's not one other auto manufacturers specifically go after.something something lgbt combined with outback hehe hehe.These Subaru shills are taking over reddit.I'm ok with thisWhen you make a good product, the shilling comes naturally.There are dozens of us! DOZENS!Fucking killed me with this one. Asking the real questions, this one.&gt;great priceYeah, okay..Okay, explain...You ever try to buy a used Subaru in an area where they are popular? I actually have, does that not confirm my theory? They retain a relatively high value because their new price is very reasonable. I honestly don't know what a new price looks like, I was just extrapolating from used prices. But looking it up, it only looks moderately reasonable to me. Anyway, I know enough to not actually get into an argument about cars with a fan of a particular brand, so I'll tongue-in-cheekily say this: my jeep XJ will still be running years after a Sub' parks for the last time in a junkyard or some mountain hippie's yard. I went to that high school. While I was there, there was one male teacher convicted of having sex with a female student, another male teacher who was convicted of exchanging nudes with a 17 year old girl in California, and a male supervisor or something (I forgot his position) convicted of soliciting prostitution. Gooooooo Hagerty. Home of the perverts. Isn't 17 the AoC in Florida?  Still creepy if the guy's like, 30. Just saying that's a legal gray areaNot for exchanging nudes. I believe it's 18 for the entire country for that. Where exchanging nudes it's 18 if one party is 17 then the older adult gets convicted of distribution/receiving CP the younger party always get's a pass even if the older person did not ever even see the photos.  Don't be Florida.  Don't be Florida.  Don't be Florida ...&gt; a substitute teacher at Hagerty High School in Seminole County, FloridaFlorida![This](https://mobile.twitter.com/MadeByTim/status/922177217068707847) also happened in Florida last night at the Colts game.Y'all Florida folks are up to some crazy shit man.Is that...Manny from Modern Family?r/gifsthatendedtoosoonJesus fuck.Haha he gets it Colts/Jags was in Indianapolis yesterdayHaa my bad.. looks like them Jags had their way both on and off the field then./r/floridawoman ?If this was a man the head line would say raped.I think I saw this in a documentary on Pornhub. Most underrated comment of the thread right here.Can't really say that when it's got a bunch of upvotes&gt; documentary on PornhubWhere all good documentaries are found. Have an upvote.She'll get five years and probation.Female teachers who do this type of shit are rarely held to the same standard of justice as male teachers. A male is violating students but a female isn't perceived as doing the same thing. It's one of those objective examples of sexism which do exist in society.Extends far outside just teachers. She will have to register as a sex offender the only way the state can keep a offender from not having to is if the offender is a minor.[This case seems to contradict that statement.](http://nypost.com/2017/02/03/teacher-who-bedded-students-wont-have-to-register-as-sex-offender/)...and yes, the offender was a woman.Because that's TX. I'm specifically talking about FL., TX. don't have mandatory life time registration. Five years you mean community service and probation.Exactly, the way this played out with her resigning, turning herself in and generally being in full cooperation I think she would only do that if they promised her no jail time.  Many rapists don't even get those 5 years, hell, some actually get less than one.What are you on about? I will agree that the fact that some people are willing to excuse female pedophile rapists if it's in a highschool environment because "I wish I had a teacher fuck me at that age!!1!!!" is disheartening.Anyone who wishes for that has no idea what kind of toll it can take on somebody if the come-on is toxic and manipulative (and given the age disparities it almost always is).Men and women convicted of the same crime serve incredibly disparate sentences. It isn't just that "some people are willing to excuse female pedophile rapists", it's that women demonstrably are more likely to avoid jail time altogether and when they do the sentence is substantially shorter than their male counterparts.I imagine you've heard that black people serve longer sentences than white people? The sentencing gap between men and women is 6 times larger than the gap between black and white people. It isn't just the public excusing the behavior. &gt; Female teachers who do this type of shit are rarely held to the same standard of justice as male teachersBut the student was female as well, so she'll get more time than a woman who did this to a male student, but less time than a male teacher doing this to a male student.&gt; She'll get five years and probation.Fives years is more than double what the average male gets for this type of crime.http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/04/a_look_at_teacher-student_sex.htmlDon't bring logic into this.I'm not American and don't exactly know where each state falls on the cultural spectrum, but in a conservative place she could have the book thrown at her because, you know, predatory homosexuals. I seem to remember a case in Alabama where the female teacher got like 30 years for touching a girl. Reddit feminists were … conflicted.&gt; predatory homosexualsNo those are only men! Only male homosexuals are gross and evil. Lesbians are only a problem when they try to get married! /sDon't forget if they aren't both attractive.[removed]Of course, they’re over 50% of the population.[removed]&gt; Yeah, I'm sure reddit "feminists" were conflicted about a fucking PEDOPHILE being sent to jail. wtf?He wasn't saying they were conflicted that they went to jail, but the reasoning that sent her there.  I could see being upset that the only reason they received a just sentence was because southerns are afraid of "predatory homosexuals".  Being right for the wrong reason isn't as good as being right for the right reason.What the hell is wrong with you that you blow up like that? I hope I never meet you while you're driving a car.Now I had to waste time looking this shit up again. [Here's the case](http://www.sunherald.com/news/local/article108753372.html), in case you want to read about it. It went down in Mississippi, sentence was passed last year.In any case it's not how *I* think, I am just reporting what I read at r/feminism (IIRC). The comments were like "Yeah, I am abviously all for hard sentences for sexual predators, but 30 frickin years for molestation, damn!" Everybody agreed that they had made an example of her and a heterosexual predator would have gotten off lighter — don't you think so too?You don’t believe that, it’s impossible to have never met a woman or speak to one. Your such a phony over the top liar lol you should of just called him an asshole She got 12 years and that case is very much different and it's [Alabama.](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ex-teacher-sentenced-sex-student-cemetery-article-1.3433460) yeah but jail is like a reward for her...Except for murder or worse, women generally tend to get off easier than men. Justice has never, and will never be blind.But what about equal rights ? Noticed it didn't say rape in the headline. Yep, female teacher. I'm sure a feminist would find a way to say this double standard in favor of women is an example of male privilege and sexism against women.Florida Man is gender fluid.Imagine if this was a male teacher.There would be a bunch of comments saying, "if this was a female teacher no one would care"."Off with his head!""Other head!"Both heads! "Castrate him with a rusty spoon"hed be charged with having sex with a minor?  &gt; The student told investigators she had consensual sex with Ms Truman between five and 10 times in a classroom at the school between March and May 2016The term "rape" is *rarely to never* uttered if the perp is female, especially if it's a teacher/student case.This is one thing that shows the lie of 'take rape seriously', it's alla big joke if the perp is female, the victim is male or if it's found to be a false accusation. It would be awesome if we could collectively actually get serious and consistent in focusing on eliminating this crime from our society.It's reporting what the student said. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h7SpXGz-XOcLiterally this.Pedophilia is wrong and in all honesty, why would you even want to have sex with a kid at that age? They're annoying. If it's post puberty it's not pedophilia, I forget the actual term for it. Someone once told me that pedophilia is actually the name for being attracted to someone underage but post puberty, and Hebophilia was being attracted to someone prepuberty.Medically theres like 4 terms each refering to a different age bracketHuh. TIL something new. I get the feeling I shouldnt google these terms thoIm pretty sure browsing wikipedia doesnt put you on any listsWell, when you work for the government...Someone told me the opposite.  I guess someone is wrong.Well, yeah, and that's horrible too. power and controlI guess I just must not be into it, because that still isn't enough to make me want to fuck one of these kids. I mean, there's the consent issues and the fact that the kid often doesn't even know what's happening, but there's also just the huge risks to your reputation and life. If you want power and control, don't be a teacher. If you want a thrill, try bungie jumping or something.Yah, I didn't mean like it was suppose to resonate with you, just that thats what some people get out of these "relationships".Crazy eyes, she has them.Florida, the American Sunderland.&gt; The former teacher has been charged with two counts of lewd acts on a minor and booked into the John E Polk Correctional Facility in Sanford.Rape, what she did was rape. I don’t give a fuck how many times the student says it was consensual. It was rape. It should be legally impossible for children to give any form of consent, especially with sex. If you want to be all legal about it, it was statutory rape, not rape.If you want to be all legal about it, it's actually supposed to be aggravated sexual battery because the teacher is in a position of power and that's how florida defines it.. so, rape, yeah.Statutory rape is, as the phrase implies, still a subset of rape. It's not statutory assault or statutory flirting. It's statutory rape.What if it is two 15 year olds having sex? If they both consented, then it's fine? Romeo and Juliet ftwIt's...not even that? Same age isn't statutory. I thought statutory is when at least one party is under the age of consent and romeo and juliet laws refer to exceptions that decriminalized accepted relationships like two 15 year olds or a 18/17 couple.&gt; romeo and juliet laws refer to exceptions that decriminalized accepted relationships like two 15 year olds or a 18/17 couple.R&amp;J is just the latter. Same-age fucking is just *legal*. And at 15, awkward.Nope it's rape. Omg we've got 15, 16, even 17 year old monsters out there raping our children! Oh the horror!! Depends. If that's below the age of consent, then they can absolutely be charged with a sex offense. It doesn't usually happen though. But I have heard of teens getting charged with distribution of child pornogrpahy for sexting, even with someone of the same age.Sexting and actually fucking are different. Boudoir photos of underage people are inherently child porn regardless of who takes 'em, but two fifteen year olds can fuck if they want to. [removed]Pictures can end up in public forums, like the internet, in which case, they're contributing to underage porn.I'm concerned that this won't be taken as seriously because there wasn't penetration with a penis involved. The local laws might even support that idea.&gt; I don’t give a fuck how many times the student says it was consensual.So we should not believe the "victim" here?Cherry picking there. It is my belief that children under the age of consent lack the capabilities to understand giving consent. They don’t understand the risks and responsibilities tied with sex. And what do you base that on?Pretty sure most people up to 25 dont understand that. And what if they proved they did by stating it very very clearly?I remember 15... and we didnt have the internet (well, we had BBSs...)... At 15 I could tell you all the the risks and responsibilities surrounding sex. Now we have the internet; alt.sex's faq from the 90s, along with all kinda other places... Sorry... that just doesnt cut the mustard logically as a blanket statement. So you’re saying you understood it 100%? You knew how to put condoms on. You knew to proper way to remove them. You understood every facet that you needed to vs a general understanding. You can know how a computer works on paper but that doesn’t mean you know how to build one.  Actually at that same age I did understand enough to build one; that was the joy of the 8 bit computer world. There were official schematics for commodore products supplied by commodore when you bought the reference guides. Electronic tinkering and computers went hand in hand. We used to draw pseudo schematics of imaginary/hypothetical computer builds.Yeah, I knew how to put on a condom the first time I used. It's not rocket science, and its cheap to experience. Taking it off also not an issue. I also understood the pill, STDS, that you could get various STDs from having sex, kissing, touching. I also understood the long term consequences of having children at an early age; like the economics and that it causes some to become crazy and depressed. As far as understanding every facet? Really? Because 25 year olds havent gotten a grasp on that either. We live in a world where a kid can learn this stuff readily; and they do learn it readily. They google and read about sex; and they google about relationships, birth control, child support, and everything else today.I'm not saying adults should have sex with minors. I'm just saying that if you are going use a other than because we say so you need to make that reason bullet proof; because kids arent buying the reasoning you are selling because its readily torn apart.Listen, I'm not defending what happened *here*, I'm just calling bullshit on some internet people thinking they knew better than the 'victim' here.She was 15, not 5 or 10...she probably knows more about sex that most adult just given the generation she grew up in.But if 'they' (again, talking about 15 year olds here) don't understand sex, then I guess we shouldn't let them make up their own minds about other aspects of their sexuality, right? Like the fact that she did this with a female makes her a lesbian or bi (or bi-curious)....should we tell her she's wrong about that? Or what about another 15 year old, fictional in this case yes but probably exists in real life, who's trans? Should we tell them they're wrong? That they'll grow out of it? She is below the age of consent. The lowest the of consent I’ve seen is 16. Legally she cannot give consent. It’s not complicated. She cannot give consent. Hence I don’t care how she said it was consensual, it wasn’t. So if two minors are caught having sex with each other... double rape?Why are you trying to defend a rapist, honestly? Do you have something against the age of consent? I don’t know what happens when minors are caught having sex with each other. But what I do know is in this particular situation the child’s “consent” is useless. This woman should be charged with rape and nothing short of it. Just demonstrating its more complicated than you think - no need to get defensive.https://www.ageofconsent.net/highest-and-lowestTalking legally is fine and all but the most traumatic part of rape is the part where you're actually unable to give your consent whether you're physically overpowered, blackmailed with threats of violence or drugged. Regardless it's still a crime, just not as damaging to the victim.oh no you can't call it rape because she's a woman and calling a woman rapist would be sexist /sThere's still a huge moral difference between consensual "statutory rape", and... you know... rapey rape.To be honest, we probably need a new word for illicit consensual sex... calling it rape cheapens the word.From what I understand, rape in a legal context only refers to anal, oral or vaginal penetration with a penis, otherwise it's  sexual assault... or something... Edit: to clarify, I think this is bullshit as well, it's just how it was explained to me by a police officer that I was discussing it with.Depends on the state. Texas has no rape charge. It is sexual assault in the penal code. But what is it called in the vaginal code?Which is ultimately discriminatory because it makes it impossible for women to be considered rapists and men to be victims. The only right way to deal with this is to base sentencing off of the teacher's attractiveness.She should reenact the scene with a woman of legal age, but dressed as a schoolgirl.  You know, to remove ambiguity.Then this bitch is fucked. For real. Ugh those jowls. This is how our justice system works.Although what she did was wrong, I don't think she deserves life in prison.She is a Paedophile...get her away from kids  It's Florida they will probably make her the school principal, the  prosecutors are all tripping over their dicks to get a date with her.   Everyone knows you don't let humans teach kids..they will want to bang them eventually.&gt;Ms Truman had been working as a sign language teacher at Lake Howell High when her employers were informed of the allegations on 2 October.Makes me wonder if the student was deaf or not.She'll probably get a far less harsh sentence than a male teacher would receive.  Equality tho..White female. She'll be fine. Shit, she's still alive. http://www.dictionary.com/browse/prejudiceWay to play up the identity politics. https://youtu.be/5gnpCqsXE8g"I don't want to give you a real response so here's an hour long video!"Raping a girl. The title is misleadingYeah it was a federal investigation because it crossed state lines Oh man she will probably get totally off I just noticed she used work from the [clerk of the court](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaclyn-truman-68220729) this is a real game changer in Florida. Didn't take long for them American female pedo worshippers to penetrate this thread. I literally only see people talking about how unfair the system is when it comes to female perps, and how they should be charged with rape. What are you talking about?You missed the person basically saying "who cares, she just ate some box"?And was heavily downvoted so what's your point?What are you confused about? OP said they only saw people taking about light sentencing being unfair. I pointed out someone that didn't. Seriously, is this exchange seriously beyond your comprehension?  You saw one person. That hardly qualifies as most people. Do you understand basic words of the English fucking language?*sigh*Quote where the person I actually responded to said "most".Can you do that?  I bet you can't.  Funny that you blast me for understanding words when you can't even fucking read :)It's implied when people start complaining about all the pedos penetrating this thread but I know that's too advanced reading comprehension for your dumbass Just to recap: You didn't read OPs post. You thought they said "most" when they didn't. You tried to talk shit but just showed that you didn't know what the fuck you were taking about. You got called out. Rather than own up to your previous fuckup, you move on to new bullshit attacks.Man, you sure are a winner. Glad we got you contributing to the thread, friend :)I literally found a guy saying "what's the problem" five seconds before reading this comment.So one comment is 'penetration'?The real 'rape culture' is female teachers preying on their students. why does weird shit always seem to happen in either Florida, Arizona or California?Arkansas was busy. The greatest porno that's never been told. God bless her.I can't wrap my head around this being criminal. At 24 I can recall pretty vividly being 15. At 15 if I got to bang this teacher I'd be ecstatic. Most of my peers lost their virginity before the age of 16 (legal age here). Arguing it will cause the teacher to have power over you rings hollow to me, as surely outing your teacher for having sex with you as a student surely gives you the upper hand if you need to play that card. I don't believe that a 15 year old is that much more inept than an 18 year old for this to be classified as rape unless she literally forced the student to have sex with her.It might be complete ignorance on my end though, so please inform me on why this is wrong to the point of being arrested (I'd be fine with her losing her job because of it, and that seems a fitting punishment). You remember being 15 but you don't remember how poorly you thought things out at that age or how easily you could be convinced to do things. I have younger cousins and spending time around them made me realize how young that age really is. Plus at this teachers age she wasn't doing this out of love she was fishing for kids to mess with then leave behind. That type of abandonment can be devastating to children. Nice!!!https://m.imgur.com/gallery/CqUuU5NJust searched her on google images ^ And watch reddit witch hunt. The girl said it was consential, so what's the issue here?Sex with minors (especially when you're their teacher) is considered an abuse of your position of authority.I'm not going to equate it with rape, but there's still a huge issue here.Fair enough. It is definitely unethical.The issue is that this is America, otherwise known as the country with rediculous aoc laws with equally rediculous sentencing all so that this woman can spend 10 years behind bars sewing Levi jeans for $.02 an hour on the tax payers dime for doing (sans the teacher part) what would be legal in 95% of the rest of the world.  I think we should just lower the age of consent to 12 like the Vatican and legalize teacher-student relationships. She can eat my puzzy anytime[deleted]The student is female. Not only did you not read the article, you didn't read the title. Nice....noice!
&gt;He said he lost his job and has spent more than £30,000 in expenses and legal fees as a result of the case.That's what happens when you stop over in Dubai!&gt; That's what happens when you stop over in Dubai!More accurately, that's what happens when you stop over in Dubai and sexually assault someone while drunk. Millions of tourists stop in Dubai every year without incident.Dont sexually assault people and get caught when its a western man's word against a middle-easterner .. you know exactly who to believe.This is also a general rue in life and on reddit.Tell me there is a kilt involved...The Middle East is a messed up place. Pretty sure that's the name of half their population.1% actually.Is Jamie Harron that popular of a name?Jamie? Yeah thats pretty common.
Facebook already makes enough off of our content.  Screw that.This. This is why I stopped building a 'Facebook community' for anyone who might want to read my stuff. They suck, they're totally in it for the profit and even if you get the Likes, you'll have to pay for your community to see your posts.will this kill fake news/profiteers from Ruritania?Nope, it will just allow facebook to profit more from it.Facebook has a "main feed"?Publishers can link content like everyone else. Net neutrality should fix this.This has nothing to do with net neutrality. Facebook is just making their free business service a paid service like a million other websites do.
i hope they find out who he is and what happened. rest in peace child. Could he have come from Cuba and was part of a group of people who tried to travel to Florida and disaster struck?  Or from Puerto Rico and got swept away by the hurricane a month ago? The way the water flow, anything from Cuba and Florida eventually passes by Texas.The article says the body was in the early stages of decomposition, so it's far too late to be related to the hurricane. I would also assume that a body floating in open sea is going to be nibbled on by fish and deteriorate quickly.If I had to guess I think the most likely scenario is a family member or caretaker who A) purposefully killed the child B) accidentally killed the child and tried to hide the body C) found the child dead on their watch and tried to hide the body. There were no missing persons report matching the description of the child, so it stands to reason the guilty party are the parents.This is very sad but the process of drawing this has to be incredibly depressing.Heartbreaking. So young... :(Upvoting for visibility. How have they ruled out that he was immigrant from central or south America?Can't think of any scenario that led to this outcome that isn't horrible. Bodies of kids don't just appear from nowhere.

Looks like I picked a great time to stop eating healthy!But a bad day to quit sniffing glue.No I still do thatI used to do drugs. I still do, but I used to, as well.Shirley they didNot me, I've got three of the recalled products in my kitchen as we speak. No diarrhea though, so I'm keeping my complaints to a minimum and returning the broccoli and brussel sprouts. Already ate half the vegetable medley though. :/I got the initial recall on Thursday, with just the manufacturer's direct products listed, then got an update on Friday with a ton of repacks.[Here](http://frg.li/ja1.pdf) is the one from Friday. It is sorted a bit better than the FDA chart, but not much better. This is the summary:* Additional information has become available.* Products were distributed to the United States and Canada.  Various broadline and produce houses are affected.* “Best if used by date” October 12 through October 20* Brands affected include: * US Food Service – Mann, Sysco Natural, Cross Valley Farms* US Retail - Archer Farms, HEB, Little Salad Bar, Mann, Mann Culinary Cuts, Mann’s Family Favorites, Mann’s Snacking Favorites, Signature Farms, Trader Joe’s, Walmart * Canada Food Service – Mann* Canada Retail – Compliments, Mann, Mann’s Culinary Cuts, Mann’s Family Favorites, Mann’s Snacking Favorites, Mann’s Snacking Favorites, Western FamilyListeria Monocytogenes are by far the most common recall I see outside of undeclared allergens (whether by manufacturing or labeling error).For reference, I see roughly five US recalls a day, but most of them are one or a handful of products and they are almost always extremely limited by production date. In this case the affected items happen to be used by a ton of grocery stores and broadliners as a source for their house-brand items, which expands the number of items dramatically.&gt; October 12 through October 20FDA post is on Oct 19.  I guess late is better then never, but still.  [Meijer](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/10/listeria_concern_prompts_recal.html) also issued recall of vegetable with the same date range and same problem.What a helpful comment, thank you. **The recalled products from Archer Farms include 12-oz. bags of the following items**: * broccoli slaw* broccoli cauliflower florets* broccoli medley* brussels sprouts. **Archer Farms' 9-oz. bags of** * shaved brussels sprouts* 10-oz. bags of cauliflower florets**At Trader Joe's*** 10-ounce bags of kohlrabi salad blend are being recalled.**Recalled products at Walmart** include 12-oz. bags of the following items: * broccoli cauliflower florets* broccoli florets* stir fry medley. **Also being recalled from Walmart are*** 32-oz. bags of broccoli florets, * 16-oz. bags of broccoli slaw, * 10-ounce bags of cauliflower florets* super blend, 6/16-oz. bags of cauliflower* 2-lb. bags of vegetable medley. &gt; The vegetable company issued the recall after one of their sampling products tested positive for **listeria.**&gt; *Symptoms of listeria infection include fever, diarrhea, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, muscle aches and convulsions, and symptoms typically appear within one to four weeks after exposure. Pregnant women, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are particularly susceptible to the infection*Let's see...Broccoli, cauliflower, broccoli, brussels sprouts, broccoli...Yeah, I'm good.All the Dragonball Super characters!Just ate TJ Kohlrabi salad last week.  Guess I'm in the clear?Is it just the fresh stuff or frozen too?Note to self, Traders Joes, Walmart and Archer Brands are all from the same manufacturer.  Private labels generally don't like revealing where their products come from. Almost all Grocers source from the same vendors/manufacturers especially for things like dairy, produce, anything unprocessed. This however doesn't mean the Grocer may not make certain requests ie Trader Joes and Whole Foods may source bread from the same bread manufacturer as walmart, but may make a request that no preservatives or only certain ingredients are used. In addition, say there was an issue in the fictional bread manufacturer, ALL products that MAY be affected get added as as precaution just on proximity. Looks like a lot of broccoli[deleted]Sounds like it. Hope you're better Reading the article shows that all the recalled products are "value added" (packaged and cut) broccoli or cauliflower mixes..(and kohlrabi)What's the point issuing a recall for food that's already expired?I would assume it's either to just formally inform stores to get rid of it. Or more likely they recall all that food to turn into feed for farm animals. Mainly pigs, they eat anything.Can pigs not get the disease? It also lets people know to be aware in case they already ate it. Like, you probably wouldn't normally go to a doctor if you get diarrhea and a headache, but if you know you ate food that was possibly tainted with listeria, you might go in just in case. This allows people to get treated earlier and more effectively, possibly saving lives. This is why I don't eat vegetables. How often are Doritos, Mountain Dew, and Twinkies recalled? Exactly.This is lazy vegetables being recalled. Value added products in plastic packaging.I can't really argue with that logic but similar arguments could be stated about frozen vegetables which are cheap.  Major contamination issues aren't a big problem for most frozen foods because the bacteria don't have a good chance to grow in extremely cold conditions.there have been ice cream recalls because of listeriaIf you cook the vegetables, would that kill off the listeria?Jokes on them, I don't eat Vegetables!I have often wondered about these food recalls... what if I just ate whatever they are recalling?  as in within the last 12 to 24 hours?   You'd probably get super powers, but don't take my word for it.The recall is apparently for listeria. unless you're immune suppressed or pregnant you're fone, and if you're immune suppressed or pregnant you take precautions against listeria.So only packaged veggies?I never buy these bagged products.  Whole broccoli and whole cauliflower are so much fresher.Frozen vegetables and fruits are just as nutritious as non frozen and canned...The products referred to in the article had "Best If Used By" dates of October 11th to October 20th and therefore could not have been frozen vegetables. These vegetables are pre-washed and cut, packaged in plastic bags and sold in the produce section.Yeah but the texture sucks.CONGRATS! I guess?It takes two minutes to wash and chop up a head of cauliflower.  With zero risk of bacterial contamination unless you are washing chicken in the same sink. Wash your own veggies, people.  Cheaper, fresher and healthier.Ughhh just be freaking happy people are eating vegetables.  Vegetables with listeria on them.
I am sorry, your title description is a bit misleading.  What was found was was not a complete round but a Sabot projectile, which are completely inert and legal to possess. The article was very misleading in the statement that police searched to make sure "there were no other explosives in the area" what it should have said is that they searched and determined there were no explosives and no one was ever in danger. This article is a good example of unresearched sensationalism journalism.In what way does the fact that is was a sabot round imply that it was inert? That is not what sabot means.Sabot rounds typically contain no explosives and are just a solid chuck of metal or other material. They're designed to defeat armor through kinetic energy.I am aware what sabot means, but the fact that what they have found it is a just the sabot and penetrator means that it is inert. This is because neither contain explosive materials. I have attached some reading material for you. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armour-piercing_fin-stabilized_discarding_sabotwhere are you seeing that they only found those parts? I dont see that anywhere in the article.The sabot and penetrator are the items present in the screen shoot on reddit and the video in the article which is a photo of the item being reported on. Like I said in my original post this article was poorly written sensationalist journalism hence the lack of meaningful technically correct information. Okay but how can you tell that it isnt an explosive round from the picture? It says the police themselves called for the bomb squad and bomb sniffing dogs, meaning that the police themselves couldnt rule out the possibility it was an explosive just from looking at it.Because I can identify it with my own knowledge, I have held one in my own hands. I can only assume a patrol officer in Harrisburg Pa may not encounter many sabot penetrators. As for the bomb squad I would say they were likely being cautious or perhaps they used the area search as a training opportunity as they mobilised and probably drove quite a distance to get there. I can only assume motivations and understanding of the people involved. I do feel that it It is better that the police investigated this sort of thing with caution until they are certain what they are dealing with and rather than handle the situation carelessly. So I wonder if that's a legit hunk of DU it if it's a steel training round. Is that casing (don't know the true name) supposed to be held together with a hose clamp or was someone putting together a souvenir? What an idiot. Everyone knows you unlock those at level 25. He obviously just leveled up and isn't used to seeing them. Fucking amateur hour.Your post is quite unreasonable. I'm calling shenanigans. I'm a ninja though, so my idea of reasonable is based on stealth and moving under the cover if night.I remain skeptical of your reasonableness. That's fairThat response was reasonable. 

I'll never understand why people flee from car accidents/crime scenes, esp. when they're leaving their cars behind? Like, where are you going to go? Maybe crash at a friend's house for the rest of your life and hope the cops don't find you? Might as well stay put and own that shit. Well if you are drunk then you can perhaps sober up before you are found.  That way they can't prove you were drinking and driving.Actually one defense I've heard is to start drinking after the accident. If you say you wernt drinking before but the accident shook you up and you needed a drink, there's really no way they can prove you were drunk before. So in that case it's fleeing an accident and the accident itself whereas drunk driving can carry stiffer penaltiesIt varies by state. I was arrested for and found not guilty of DUI in Pennsylvania. I hit a deer around 8pm going to a college graduation party, called a tow truck then got a ride to and from the party. Apparently the night guy calls the police for that towtruck company and lists everyone who used their service so police visit them, so the cops showed up to my house at 2am and I was piss drunk. Then they slapped me with a bunch of other charges like failure to wear a safety belt. The police report didn't even have a time for the accident so they left it blank to avoid admitting they were 6 hours late. Cost about 5000 dollars but I was found not guilty. Then over a year later I got a letter from Penndot telling me they made an administrative decision and placed a DUI on my driving record.From what I was told in PA the police have 2 hours from the accident time to find you to state you're drunk, hence why they left the time of my accident blank. So if you crash your car drunk at 5pm, they find you at a bar at 6pm, you're getting a DUI. If you crash your car sober at 5pm, start drinking and they find you drunk at 6pm you also get a DUI. And if you hit a deer sober at 8pm and they find you at 2am drunk they'll just not list a time and make you spend 5,000 to get found not guilty.What if someone just kept a bunch of beer in their trunk at all times, so if this ever happens, they can just start cracking them, then tell the cops "Well I crashed, couldn't go anywhere, so I figured I'd crack a few cold ones"... can't prove it's not the case lol.Even if they find you drunk, are you going to get in less trouble than you would for fleeing? (Of course, I doubt an intoxicated person would really think this through the same way a sober person would ...)You get in less trouble for fleeing an accident than you do for drinking and driving.Simple. You run home and call the cops to report your car stolen.Misdemeanor leaving the scene or felony drunk driving.  They can't prove you're drunk at the time of the crash, at which point it becomes fleeing the scene if they even bother to prosecute it. That's assuming nobody is hurt.Fight or flight!Because if they can't prove you were driving, you walk. And since your car was stolen, insurance pays.
The headline makes it seem like the killer is targeting kids. They are not. Several victims in their 20s and 30s have been killed around bus stops, so now the police are protecting kids going to bus stops.I'm sure we've all seen enough episodes of Criminal Minds to understand that the killers MO really doesn't include kids, so this is a precautionary measure that is also probably being done as a bit of a PR move to make residents feel safer, both of which are good reasons I suppose.
&gt;Later in the afternoon, the girl’s 12-year-old brother was on the bus about to be dropped off near their home when the bus was flagged down by the stalker, police said. The man told the driver he was there to pick up the boy, officials said, but the driver told the man he was not authorized to pick him up.&gt;The driver **told him to leave before he called police**...Or when someone tries to kidnap a child in your care you could just *call the fucking police*. Does this bus driver not have two brain cells to rub together!? I actually think that was probably the right move. The important thing was to get the boy out of immediate danger, which chasing the stalker off would do. Once the stalker was no longer an immediate threat, the driver could call the police.So rather than threaten the kidnapper and scare him off, you'd prefer him to allow the kidnapping to happen, and just report it?Do you not see the difference between "Leave or I'm calling the police" and "Hello dispatch, there's a man trying to kidnap one of the schoolchildren on my bus"? This is a shoot on site person to me. Which site should they shoot him on?Lol, I use site so much at work I just auto typed it. You know what I mean though.&gt; Which site should they shoot him on?whichever site he's standing on What a sick fuckin world we live in.I know, creepy!Where's the parents in this story? No police after the first contact? I would have beaten that guy to death by now. Are there human traffickers targeting Brooklyn?https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170927/park-slope/attempted-kidnapping-19th-street-nypd
Just a reminder:  Bergdahl's story about trying to protest to his command is provably a lie.Bergdahl was temporarily posted to the Mest OP (Observation Point), and his permanent station was the Sharana FOB (Forward Operations Base) to the northeast of Mest OP.  The first indication of his capture was a Low-Level Voice Intercept of an unidentified male talking about an American soldier with a camera looking for someone who speaks English.  This communication was intercepted by a Guardrail signals intelligence aircraft, which used direction finding to determine the location of the transmission.  It was about 9.8 miles to the south-southeast from Mest, in totally the wrong direction Bergdahl would have to head in order to get back to his unit at Sharana FOB.His lawyers claim he got turned around in the mountains, which is a bunch of hooey because there were no mountains of any significance between where he was stationed and where he was captured, and Bergdahl was known for taking long multi-day hikes by himself back in the mountains of Northern Idaho where he grew up:https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/us/many-sharp-turns-in-bergdahls-path-to-army.html&gt;Although his home life was strict, Sergeant Bergdahl was given a long leash by his parents to explore Idaho on foot or bike or motorcycle, and was taught to be self-sufficient. **“If there’s anyone from Blaine County who could take a compass and a knife and walk off into the mountains to survive on squirrels, it was Bowe,” one friend said.**...&gt;“He was a seeker,” said Sue Martin, the owner of Zaney’s River Street Coffee House in Hailey, where Sergeant Bergdahl worked as a barista.** He asked for, and received, special dispensation to disappear for days, on a bike ride, a hike, or some other journey. **He had a compass with him when he walked away from Mest OP.  I find it difficult to believe he got "turned around" and lost, him having the experience he did solo hiking and otherwise journeying through the mountains near Hailey and Ketchum, ID.I think he was flat-out deserting.  If you extend the line from Mest OP through the grid square where he was caught by the Taliban, you'll see it leads to a river valley that is the only practical way to travel into Pakistan on foot.  It's about a 92 mile hike that way to get over the border, most of it in that valley.  The closest point is about 30 miles away from Mest OP, which would probably be a couple days walk for him.  After that, he'd have access to water, and navigation would have been simple:  Follow the river downstream until you get to the border.A couple of maps to illustrate what I'm talking about:https://imgur.com/a/4PyQThttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertion#Penalties&gt;  No U.S. serviceman has received more than 24 months imprisonment for desertion or missing movement post-September 11, 2001.I don't think, even with the current President, that this will change.I think it should change, *pour encourager les autres*.  After all, 2 years is basically nothing, and this is walking away from your post in the middle of an active war in an active war zone. He should be in jail right next to Bradley Manning.  Unfortunately, Manning has already been released. Manning did a lot of way worse stuff.No manning was an idiot but this guy was a straight up fucking traitor. And releasing tens of thousands of documents, which Manning herself even stated she didn't read before taking them and giving them away is.... what exactly?They're 2 sides to the same coin. The only difference is Manning's actions happened to not lead to any US personnel getting injured/killed.Oh yeah manning is a traitor for sure what he did was outrageously fucking dangerous. But this dude got people hurt, people lost their legs and ability to speak over this fuck. SEAL's careers were ended over it. Fuck both of them.Manning should be back in solitary until she dies but this guy should be executed right out if the gate. &gt; Manning should be back in solitary until she dies but this guy should be executed right out if the gate."But we're way better than the terrorists we're fighting, definitely guys."fun fact, manning did nothing wrong, and bergdahl's desertion wasnt wrong either.You misspelled “uninformed opinion”nope, neither one has even been accused of wrongdoingThey’ve both been convicted of wrong doing. Wtf are you on about?“Chelsea” Manning now. She went on a hunger strike to force the military to give “her” a gender transition. When he cuts off his penis, I’ll start calling him Chelsea. If he won’t commit, I’m not sure why I should. [Manning wanted to have the procedure done](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/chelsea-manning-lose-transgencer-benefits-us-army-military-prison-barack-obama-president-commutation-a7535216.html), but couldn't because her benefits were cutoff by the military. It's not an issue of "committing." The cost of the surgery is like $25-50k.Also, they don't cut off their penis. They invert it.First, I didn’t see anything in the article that said he wanted to undergo surgery. Second, if he is committed, I bet he could run a “Go Fund Me” campaign and he’d get plenty in donations to take care of it. [According to this article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/09/13/chelsea-manning-undergo-sex-reassignment-surgery/90331678/), it was in the works while she was in prison. Either way, who gives a shit? If someone wants to live life as a woman, it doesn't bother me.why do you want to punish people for doing good thingsI think the real punishment should go to whoever decided it was a good idea to ship a guy that got kicked out of the frickin Coast Guard for being screwed up in the head to Iraq. He's already served his time, no one has gotten more than 5 years for desertion since WWII, and he spent 5 in a Taliban prison. A long drop and a short stop would be appropriate. I would be happy with a life sentence, and a public cashiering/drumming out on his way into Ft. Leavenworth.So am I fucking insane, or what? I can't find a single piece of hard evidence that Bergdahl abandoned his post or sympathized with the Taliban, and it looks like he has consistently maintained his own innocence since his release.**EDIT:** I'll avoid expressing confusion over a convoluted series of events from now on lmao.As an aside, I worded this poorly. I realize now that he admitted to abandoning his post, but what I'm more concerned about is this narrative that he was a "terrorist sympathizer" and not the victim of a kidnapping and torture at the hands of the Taliban.Anyway, keep up the... bizarre conservative echo chamber (and somehow transphobia, even?) dominating this thread. Love you guys, you're priceless.Or maybe the word is worthless. I dunno.He admitted he walked off post and knew they would notice he was missing but said he did not think they would mount a search and rescue mission for a private (which is pretty stupid if he thought that). He claims he was going to see higher ranking officials to report issues with his unit.No idea if he had/has any sympathy for the Taliban but that is actually irrelevant to the issue of desertion.  If you haven't listened to Serial season 2 and you are interested in this topic, you really should. Your description is a bit reductive, and the podcast goes more in depth on his claimed motivations.I distinctly recall that the unit had problems with this before, people in general walking away from their post, and had been disciplined. Furthermore Bergdahl was known to have psych problems. To me this whole thing seems like him doing something he and other members of the unit have done before, this time he just got caught.No one has gotten more than 5 years for desertion since WWII anyway, 5 years in a Talking prison seems like time served to me, if they want to tack on another 5 so be it.Serial season 2 podcast I was just going to post this.  Really good listen if you have ~5 hours.For sure! I went in to it with no opinion either way on the case and came out feeling much more equipped and informed to form an opinion about the case, which ultimately is very nuanced and qualitative. Did you maybe spend 2 seconds researching first?He wrote  a note to his parents about it, stacked all his gear into a nice little pile and then snuck off base. He admitted to everything, what planet are you living on. &gt; Did you maybe spend 2 seconds researching first?&gt; He wrote a note to his parents about it, stacked all his gear into a nice little pile and then snuck off base. He admitted to everything, what planet are you living on.I've never heard the last part about "stacking his gear into a nice little pile," but yeah, he wrote his dad a fucking angsty letter. He was a young man with a garbage duty station in the middle of the fucking desert.Being a pissy little kid in a uniform doesn't make you a traitor. Without the context of age and situation, any young person could be made out to be a gigantic asshole.What I also recently read is this:&gt; Sgt Bergdahl said he walked off his combat post to prove to senior officers his commanders were "unfit" for service.Which makes absolutely no sense to me. Like, I can't even figure out what he's talking about.Yes, he did abandon his post. But what he's also being accused of by the media and politicians is intentionally working with the enemy, of which I can find absolutely no evidence.Yeah he took all his gear and stacked it up, instead of taking it with him like literally any soldier would do when they leave the wire.As far as intentionally working for the enemy I don't think he did imo&gt;  I can't find a single piece of hard evidence that Bergdahl abandoned his post"**I left my observation post** on my own," Bergdahl told a judge Monday. "I understand leaving was against the law."I'd missed his most recent comments—made last week, I believe. I wasn't aware that he'd stated anything else since his initial account of events years ago.I also worded my confusion poorly. I meant less the physical act of leaving his post and more the accusation that he left his post *to join the Taliban*, which is what the (conservative) media has been accusing him of for a long time.So, he said this:&gt; During Monday's hearing, he told the court: "I was captured by the enemy against my will."But prior to that, he stated:&gt; Sgt Bergdahl said he walked off his combat post to prove to senior officers his commanders were "unfit" for service.I don't understand what that means. Like, now his story genuinely confuses me.He's liberal and weird so they're going to kill him.He abandoned his post as he had done many times before, the whole platoon was a shit show. They tried to make him out to be a traitor when really he wasn't breaking any more rules than the rest were. They were covering their own asses after having been disciplined before and failing to correct their actions.Where are you getting this nonsense from. The dude has been admitting his guilt the whole time. Check out the second season of the serial podcastYeah, and it's also known he wasn't the only one doing shit he wasn't supposed to. He admits to desertion, not working for the Taliban.Yeah, and his conviction is for desertion. What is your point? Seriously, listen to the serial podcast about this and honestly tell me you think this guy isn’t a complete asshole.  I think he shouldn't have been there in the first place, and I also think his squad is at fault for doing the same exact shit. To me he seems exactly what you'd expect from someone who's mentally I'll in a combat zone. Beyond the desertion charge he hasn't really done anything wrong. The guy was in a worse place than a military prison for five years, if you want to tack on another five go ahead, I just think it is unnecessary.They threw the headcase in with the shitheads and thought it'd be a lovely combo. I guess the military was hurting for volunteers that much that they had to take people kicked out of other branches of the Armed Services.No question he shouldn’t have been there. And the military knew it too. I think there should be some consequences for how he was able to enlist after what happened with him in the coast guard for sure. As for his punishment. I totally agree that to some extent he’s already been punished a fair bit for his behavior. I’m not sure the proper punishment that needs to be added to that. If no one had been hurt looking for him or we hadn’t needed to trade five high profile prisoners to get him back I’d say he’s served his time at this point. But given the reality of those extra details I’m unsure. Life in prison seems overboard but nothing seems to not fit either. I don’t envy the judge on this one. However it turns out though this guy is an asshole. Still don't see how the guy is an asshole. From what I understand he foolishly thought he could have a relationship with the locals and tried to do shit with them by himself. If I were a judge I'd give him time served and let him be an example of why people don't desert. I'm sure the government has withheld a lot of details of his captivity that can be used to teach recruits why they shouldn't wander off.I also say I don't see how he's really an asshole because his squad was such shit. If I were him I'd probably try to get away from those fuck heads too.He had no regard for the solders he put in harms way  by running off. The dustwun he kicked up involved huge percentages of active military and intelligence forces both in country and back home. He did it all out of a delusional self aggrandizing notion that he was some kind of super solder who was going to single handedly save the day by running away (though how has never been clear). I don’t think he’s a traitor, I’ve not seen any evidence to support him trying to join the taliban. I don’t think he’s the devil or an enemy combatant. But he is clearly guilty of desertion. His desertion selfishly put other people needlessly in danger. Any reasonable person in his position would have known that. That’s why I say he’s an asshole.It’s clear he’s already received harsh punishment at the hands of his captors. I don’t know what the right punishment should be at this point. But it’s not hard for me to condemn what he did.He wanted to create relationships with the locals, completely distinct from being in the armed forces. The dude was a whack job, and so were most of his squadmates. I don't think their behavior should be ignored in this as they were almost complicit.Any punishment he receives will probably be a slap on the wrist compared to what he experienced, unless they ship him to Gitmo.
Can I just say that this is fucking hilarious:&gt;In 2009 a Grant High School student posted a video online that showed Scott teaching a sex education class for 10th-grade students. He was wearing a condom on his head and a pair of red underwear over his pants with a hole in the middle.&gt;The school district told him to never do that again.I certainly would like to see that lesson unfold.That should be the default teaching method.Someone has to be able to find that videohttp://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2009/02/health_class.htmlVideo is apparently removed.

He regularly groped blind women. We received an email saying, "A blind victim noted that he had large hands and smelled spicy." It turned out to be an adjunct professor.Gross! What a dirty dog.  Taking advantage of the blind is pretty sick.  Can't imagine living with myself after doing stuff like that We had a serial gropist at the college I work at a few years ago. 5'4" Chinese man. The campus police couldn't catch the guy for like a whole month. He was notoriously fast and sneaky. Please tell me he used smoke bombs and yelled “ninja vanish!” after he groped someone.That's Japanese.The perfect disguise.Ninjas are originally Chinese.  The concept migrated to Japan during the Edo period.As did groping. Coincidence? I think not.Don't be silly.[Ninjas come from Poland](http://snafu-comics.com/swmcomic/ninja-origins/)."Close enough for me, they're all the same."-/u/RepublicanScumDude just lost his shit one day and went on a grope spree I prefer mass gropings to mass shootings any day.something something "bump stock"I'd rather mass grapings. I would rather have mass shootings than any sort of groping or rape.So you’d rather get shot than groped?Ah the good old "rape is worse than death" moron. You're the moron. Tell me how death is worse than rape. If you're dead, you're dead. If you're a rape survivor you have to deal with lifelong trauma including severe PTSD, its harder to have pleasurable relationships (including not having been able to commit yourself to your partner), you have to deal with a justice system and society that doesn't punish culprits as heavily as they should, and you obviously have the misogynistic speech seen online and in person that can make it even harder to deal with what you experienced. Most people agree that suffering before death is horrible, and hope that they, and their loved ones pass away quickly and quietly. Thats the whole pro of Euthanasia. We all hope that we pass in our sleep, and feel bad when someone suffers horribly before death. Yet somehow, spending the rest of your life as a rape survivor is preferable to death. Thats a lot more suffering than what you would typically experience before death. Do you see how illogical that is, or are you too thick?Even the statistics support me.https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violenceRead the section titled "Sexual Violence Can Have Long-Term Effects on Victims". It will tell you how horribly rape victims are affected, and how many contemplate or attempt suicide.Here's another source that backs it up;https://mainweb-v.musc.edu/vawprevention/research/mentalimpact.shtmlYour statement is just ridiculous.Yes being raped is horrific, but that doesn't mean every victim wishes they were dead. They don't live in mental agony all day every day for the rest of their life, and being groped is way way down the list of things people would rather happen than being shot. In a mass shooting, people don't get the nice clean instant death that you describe, even if you are killed, it can take days or weeks of suffering first. Most people aren't even killed, they might lose limbs, or mental capacity, never be able to walk or see again even after years of painful rehabilitation, not to mention the medical bills that mean you'll never be out of debt again.If you are killed, there's no coming back from it, no growing older, no seeing the people you love again. People have lost a parent, sister, child, best friend teacher forever and have to live with that pain for the rest their lives. So please stop wishing mass shootings on people, "as long as no one was raped" you ignorant fuckwit. Jesus... You're insane. &gt; Tell me how death is worse than rape. If you're dead, you're dead. That's how. Because you are dead, instead of being alive. That's how it's worse.it was his first day.And his last!Yeah, give him a break.  Everyone screws up a little when it's their first day on the job.He didn’t even get to the “no groping” part of the employee handbook yet smhGuy was probably fighting it for so long lol[removed]He sounds presidential Reddit silverI'm impressed. I never groped one seventh grade girl much less six on the same day. Then again I'm not a sexual predator. I thought you were going to say "Then again, I'm not a gym teacher."My brother told me not to join the volleyball or softball team because the coach was a creep. My bro was a janitor at the school and heard of some rug sweeping.Well, of course he did. Isn't that part of his job?I have never swept a rugThat sounds like he molested loudly.Nah, just made some creepy remarks to people when he thought he was in safe company. "Get to watch hot girls shower" probably.Never specified. Maybe I'll shoot him a text.On my phone the line break is in the perfect spot too. God. That reminds me of the time in 7th grade, one of the bitchier girls claimed that I groped her chest in English. In reality, we were turning in our papers to the desk and I got stuck in the middle of everyone. I had to push my way out and apparently, one of my arms touch her breast. I didn't know because I didn't feel anything and she didn't say anything to me. She just decided to go to the school councilor. It was bullshit but at least I didn't get in any trouble because there were no witnesses.TL;DR  I was accused of groping when I actually didn't.&gt; I didn't know because I didn't feel anythingOoh, that sly burn. You should've told her that.Well, I did say that verbatim when speaking to the councilor. &gt; It was bullshit but at least I didn't get in any trouble because there were no witnesses.There are plenty of people who think she shouldn't need evidence and her mere words should be enough.We learned very little from the Salem witch trials and the McCarthy era communist blacklists. We learned a TON from them both.And turned them into uber-successful Republican tactics.Republican? It's hardly them that are pushing the "guilty until proven innocent" method with regards to sexual crimes.I have plenty to dislike about the RepubliCAN'Ts but the transition from the comment you replied to to yours makes no sense.If you say so.I offer as evidence: the entire eight years that Obama was President and the most recent presidential campaign.&gt;the most recent presidential campaign.Oh yes, that one. That one where both Hillary and Bernie were on record, multiple times, as being totally and 100% sure that Trump hadn't paid any taxes in 25 years -- Hillary even heavily pushed the idea of having people show up to Trump rallies dressed as Donald Duck, because "Donald Ducks His Taxes!".Then MSNBC announced that they had Trump's tax return. And holy shit, people were jerking themselves off *raw*. I thought they were going to strain something. "This is the end of Trump! Shortest presidency ever! He'll resign tomorrow before it gets released, I guarantee it!"And what happened?It turned out that both Bernie and Hillary were wrong. He paid taxes. Slightly more than the average American household, slightly less than average for someone of his declared income.And yeah, that stung. That stung because I supported Bernie in the election and *reluctantly* switched to Hillary when he was knocked out.I don't care when Trump lies to me because I know he lies all the time and I don't trust him. I care when *Bernie* and *Hillary* lie to me because I trust them. And they lied to me.Yeah those are extremely mild examples. Whereas the Republican smear campaigns against 8 years of Obama and everything that's come out of the mouths of Trump and his supporters during the elections and his presidency are completely abhorrent and unprecedented.This isn't a case of "lolol politicians lied, but I didn't think MY politician would lie, therefore Trump's ok cause I expect him to". This is a case of standards dropping so far down the Bagram portapotty that we aren't just using McCarthy tactics, we're using McCarthy tactics with the grace of an irate kindergartener **and taking it as normal**.Because lolol you already expect Trump to lie, so no biggie.

It’s a joke man. Chill out. There’s nothing wrong with making light out of serious things. Keeps you from being depressed all the time because of bad things always happening in the world.How about actually dealing with the terrible things instead of joking at the victims expense?Oh well because this is reddit. You want Facebook for that. Trying too hardWhat's really funny is 11 hours after he got all white knighty about making insensitive jokes, he replied to a thread entitled "Just like breathing, what is something your body does automatically that you wish you could take control of at times?" with ["Punch crying babies in grocery stores"] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/785cex/just_like_breathing_what_is_something_your_body/dor7vxk/)Apparently he thinks joking about punching babies is all in good fun but joking about molesting children is just *abhorrent*.No, but you encourage minimalizing it and making the conversation about your shitty joke (at someone else's expense) instead of talking about the issue at hand.No, it doesn't. *clutches pearls [dramatically]( https://youtu.be/YoIlgZbFORM)*Hey, if you're okay with having sex with kids, that's on you. [removed]He's only kidding.Is that what they call it now?*kid*dingFuck, that's a good one. I don't know. Seems pretty juvenile.The child inside me is touched by it. Sooo....[does that mean you support punching babies in grocery stores?] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/785cex/just_like_breathing_what_is_something_your_body/dor7vxk/)Must be nice living your life holding others to standards that you yourself can let slide.For some people, a joke is never 'too soon'. I'm one of those people. I don't know where your line in the sand is, and sometimes I cross my own line. I joke because it's a way of coping in a world where a teacher can grope multiple girls in a single day like he thinks he's the President. It's terrible and tragic, but it works for meThen joke about your own misery, not someone else's at their expense.I bet you get butthurt at 9/11 jokes too.Never forgetYou're taking a lot of liberties with that statement because no one said that the subject is objectively funny and no one said they support it. Humor is an extremely effective medium with which to process [name a thing]. Saying that someone "supports child molestation" because they make a pretty harmless, nonspecific joke regarding the subject is worse. One of two things is happening: either you're making a real, serious accusation because you believe it's true, or you know it's not true and you're just mad. In which case I don't understand how it isn't obvious to you that your reaction is much worse than the jokes themselves. No you're using humor to minimalize the subject (at the other persons expense) and this is often what people who actually commit these crimes do.Its ok to treat a subject with the gravity it deserves, especially since the world does a good job of not taking other people's suffering seruously normally. And you were just a part of that.Also, how many people in this thread have mentioned how horrible this is compared to how many people are joking?You're just an asshole who says cruel things and then says "jk!!!" stop using jokes to belittle people and stop acting like jokes are helping you deal with the world - because you just make it more difficult for actual victims to be taken seriously.First: I hear you. Second: Sorry for the novel that's about to happen. I want to get a civilized rapport going about this because I agree with some of what you're saying and I want us to understand each other. I'm not using humor to minimalize the subject at all. I have used it to minimalize my feelings of powerlessness, because I'm speaking on this subject as a survivor of sexual assault and later  on of ongoing sexual abuse. Unless someone can say the same (I'm not saying you can't - I don't know you and it would be insensitive of me to assume), there's no way for them to have an accurate, firsthand perspective of coping and healing afterward. People who have never experienced sexual assault or abuse don't understand how empowering humor can be. It's therapeutic to laugh in the midst of something so horrible and serious; it helped give me my life back. I don't feel that using humor as a processing or coping method diminishes what happened to me. Making jokes was what first gave me the ability to talk about and truly acknowledge the events. That being said, when I reread that bit, I see the subjectivity much more clearly. I'm still aware of what I say and around whom it is said, because I don't want to hurt anyone who may be struggling to heal. I get it, and I'll give you that. Also you're not wrong that people often do make jokes to diminish others' experiences and trauma - though I feel like gaslighting and victim blaming are much more common in this regard. Nevertheless, I'll partially concede on that point as well. I still feel that so plainly accusing someone of _supporting_ sexual assault in response to a joke that is in no other way indicative of an offender is troubling. It's okay to feel like the joke is in bad taste or poorly timed. It's good to be able to empathize with people who feel unheard and to give them a voice. Survivors who aren't where I am in the healing process may need that kind of support more than I did/do and may not respond to humor as a coping mechanism. It's shortsighted of me to suggest that humor is a universal cure-all. But still I have to disagree with the idea that the people making the jokes in this thread _actually support sexual assault_ because that's a very serious accusation - real or not. I don't want to accuse someone who may be a survivor and may be using humor to cope, any more than I want to use humor in front of someone who is having trouble coping. I hope that makes sense. I'm so tired. I fell asleep writing this like three times. Damn, dude.  Who touched you?See? A perfect example of how you don't care about other people who have been sexually abused. I'm sure you actually get the gravity of the issue and are using laughter to deal with it.Nah. You're just an asshole with little life experience having a gaff at someone else's misery.Does the definition of molestation include inappropriate touching with clothing on?  I'm asking because I presumed it to be far worse acts than that.  I think that's why its been referred to as groping in this case.&gt;Does the definition of molestation include inappropriate touching with clothing on? Not that I agree with him, but that is obviously molestation.I wonder what his thought-process looked like that day..."Wow that was a nice feeling I got right there! Let's try that again!""Again...""Ooooo, again!""Another!""This is fun!""Phweeee! Tingly feeling!"Ten bucks he's turning senile/dementia. That's what I thought when I read this article.FOX News also reported that they will be hiring him as their new prime-time anchor.No, he's going to become a Hollywood producer and make huge contributions to the Democratic party!Anyone ever notice that Fox "News" overwhelmingly reports incidents like this, often without all the facts, and only about public schools?They don't ever report on it when some pedophile priest or nun molests a child in private / Catholic school, or a rabbi sexually assaults some kid in Temple.It's just echoes of the so-called "culture war" mixed in with vile hatred of the public school system.To be fair, public cases are going to be far more common because:1. There are a LOT more public schools than private schools.  2. Private schools are better able to cover up controversies.  3. Private schools are better able to fire bad employees without making waves as Teachers Unions don't have to vet the firing.Rupert MurdochIt's hard to know what's going on in home schools.Home school rocked by scandal as faculty sexual relationship is uncovered!The Child entered their parents room to find 'their dad fucking their mom, at the scene is a midget in a bikini'It's almost like Fox News isn't really news at all, but rather just the propaganda arm of the Republican party.Wow you guys are so insightful, tell me more!He's the gropist! He gropes the kids!We need to write a song to show we don’t grope the kidsThis website is cancer. Even after turning off ublock origin I couldn't figure out what was going on. Fucking ads and trackers for days.Molested by adsIf this article was about a female substitute groping male students, this comments' section would be filled with outrage about how women are treated better with things like this.However, it's a dude, and this comments section is mostly jokes... cause people are shitty. Not if she was a fat 66 year old woman. It would be the same thing. Crazy old lady jokes.Now make it a hot younger guy of 36 or hot younger lady of 36 and then we'd have battles in the comments section. I was subbing in one of the local middle schools and late 30s something health teacher is some ripped in shape dude. The girls would literally lick their lips and flutter their eyes at him. Stop putting hormones in the milk folks.on the same day? jeez what a jerkIn a row?!?Would have been fine if he was a movie producer.Took one look at him and decided guilty. He's 66, where did he find the energy?At the pharmacy He found the fountain of youth(s) aka High SchoolIt seems like guys that age don't really care for the difference between 14 and 24. Not that you should do this to any age.Fucking shoot him deadthis teacher was playing 4d chess, fuck waiting for physicals, he just wanted to do them himselfVolleyball tryouts?Trying to teach them how to dodge for his upcoming dodgeballs class. &gt;Defense attorney Jacob Houze said Scott was falsely accused. He noted inconsistencies and contradictions in the students' statements, and said police neglected to interview other students who may have been witnesses.Ultimately interviewing other witnesses is the job of the defense attorney.Perhaps it happened and didn't work in favor of the defense.The whole thing seems strange though. I can buy a teacher that gets revealed as having secretly molested students throughout the years, but a dude that randomly molested six in one day and nothing else? On the other hand, he could have before and no one came forward.Weird all around.It's possible the man in in the early stages of dementia.also possible that he's completely innocent. It's a matter of probabilities and to see if the stories by the girls hold up. I work at a public K-12 and we had a well-respected male teacher, with a clean record, accused of some kind of sexual impropriety by a female student. It turned out he was completely innocent and she lied to get back at him over a bad grade she had received. He did not get his job back either...To be falsely accused of child molestation has got to be one of the most terrifying experiences in life.                                                                                                                                                                                  I can't even imagine what he went through. That said, the accusations of these girls need to be taken seriously but w/ a true intent on justice and not just on vengeance. I hope the investigation gives him a fair chance.I hope so too.
I wonder if other countries think America is indoctrinating our children to be warriors.  Nerf guns are ubiquitous and awesome at the same time, and of course our tv and video games are dripping with it.It's not like advertisements for guns in the media are a new concept. [Just look at this shit from the 50s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrEcFFSnxE). Not to mention honoring the troops before every football game.Every sporting event Uh yeah, I mean think about how fucking weird it is that we have children recite a pledge of allegiance every morning 

Hey. I'm going to Igiugig in a few months :)Neat! What for? When I was in college I read a book with several essays in it, one of them by Dr. Orlan Svingen, who was teaching the class. He wrote about a museum returning remains taken from a reservation. At some point in the ceremony, one of the elders makes the comment that they are glad to receive the coffins of their ancestors and will bury them where they belong.The reply from the curator was "those are not coffins, they're just storage boxes." Right in front of everyone. I remember right after that, he wrote something to the effect of "the (curator's name) of the world will always be there to remind Indians they don't even warrant coffins. Just storage boxes.""don't warrant coffins" is a pretty dumb statement to try to make back though, while it was distasteful of curator to say that. It's a museum, not a funeral home. Of course it's going to be boxes. Right next to the storage boxes of white/black/whatever bones.There’s a huge difference between the remains of someone who died recently, and ten thousand year old remains.  Nobody knows if someone 10k years old had any descendants, or even if they were part of a tribe.Also people dont really care about their forefathers remains from hundreds of years ago.That's horrendous :(Surely the Smithsonian was keeping all the disturbed ghosts a secret from the public. Just like the giants and dragons they have hidden from us. /sAt least they'll be in a much better condition now than if they hadn't been kept at the SmithsonianGood. It's much too long after the signing of NAGPRA for these remains to be repatriated.Smithsonian was exempt from NAGPRA.Yes I understand, but the spirit of NAGPRA still holds. Also, the Smithsonian still has to make similar efforts under the National Museum of the American Indian Act.The spirit means nothing when it's specifically exempted. And I'm fully aware of the NMAI. My point still stands because it was to correct your use of a law that does not apply.I didn't "use the law;" I pointed out that it past time for the Smithsonian to follow suit since the passage of that law. The law was a milestone, an important shift in national policies toward native peoples.Not sure why the idea gets you so butthurt, but I hope you have a better day.You're attempting to USE the existence of the law to make a point. I'm sorry this conversation is to difficult for you to grasp. If you can't deal with someone correcting your mistakes without claiming they're "butthurt", you're likely the one that needs a better day.i like this. im very superstitious so messing with the dead is bad juju. plus i mean if its educational purposes plastic or some other kind of makeshift model would suffice imoYeah I'm sure those 87 years of bad juju really gave us a wallop.

There are some places people from the West just shouldn't go. And yet we still do. Dubai is a horrible place built and maintained by modern slavery. People are attracted by the wealth on the surface, but ignore the risks associated with the backwards culture.100% true! UAE gets their cheap labor from the South and Southeast Asian countries where men are offered little pay, but continuous work so that money could be sent back home to their families. It's incredibly sad to see the conditions they are housed in to build unnecessary structures, majority of which aren't even occupied due to the exorbitant prices. Understandably, cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi want their citizens to be exposed to the Western culture; yet, ironically, people who can afford to, for example, go to Ski Dubai are the ones who can afford to travel abroad to get the real experience! And when solar/renewable energy finally takes over, that city is going to be abandoned overnight and swallowed up by the desert. Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!Nothing beside remains. Round the decayOf that colossal Wreck, boundless and bareThe lone and level sands stretch far away.That is moving. Reference?[Ozymandias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias?wprov=sfla1)So this chap tells this other chapSome damned clap-trapAbout how somewhere on the old mapHe's seen these de-bagged legs, and to capIt all, not a scrapOn top of them, bugger all on tapBut the desert sands and similar pap-- Just a bloody great gap --And the owner, poor sap,Has had stencilled under the whole mishapHow one and all should funk and flapRe his efforts.

I haven't seen the other 8.Ozymandias https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3dpghfRBHEBrian Cranston is King of Kings. Thanks for the link!Dubai has long moved on from petroleum. Oil only accounts for around 6% of their GDP now.&gt; Real estate and construction (22.6%), trade (16%), entrepôt (15%) and &gt;financial services (11%) are the largest contributors to Dubai's economyFrom  Wiki; most of their economy is based on real estate/construction and trade...which means they really don't have anything worthwhile.  Avoid at all cost.Only Dubai itself. The UAE is still very much reliant on oil.And they are all preparing for the future like Dubai did. Except for the crash during the recession, Dubai has never relied on Abu dhabi money. Those are smart fucks even if they are medieval.Dubai made itself into a luxury resort town to attract tourism and bring in money. Problem is if they keep living with their antiquated laws and outsiders get arrested for things like this that tourism money will go elsewhere.Exactly. If I can't go around touching man hips I'm taking my money elsewhere. And they're even more backwards if you're a woman. No thanks.As nice as that'd be, by then they will own enough assets worldwide to live off the dividends. Gulf sovereign wealth funds are buying up massively.Like Spec Ops The Line?I've played Spec Ops: The Line and Dubai swimming in sand won't be pretty if that game has a sliver of prophecy to it. Yep. The in two generations, the current ruler's grandchildren will find cars buried in the sand and worship them as gods. And who cares. Go back to your primitive bullshit and forget that the rest of the world tried to drag you to civilization for a century.People still go to North Korea and Afghanistan too. I don't get it, but some people are just foolish.Indeed, and it just so happens the guy was working as an electrician in Afghanistan and was only stopping over in Dubai. I knew a guy who worked for the UN in Liberia/Afghanistan its crazy how much someones acceptable level baseline sense of security can be so elastic.When you get offered six figures to do a 3 or 4 month job your sense of self preservation ebbs just a bit.But they have cool cars?LOL! True, but if you want to see cool cars, you don't need to venture too far, just go stand outside Harrods in England, especially in the summer months. Arab royalty traditionally shop there and will park their cars for all to see so you'll get a good closeup :)Or go to Monaco, you get the same over the top luxury, but with less slavery.It's definitely on the list especially when the Grand Prix is taking place!Shouldn't we be issuing travel warnings for these places?I don't understand why anyone goes to a dictatorship, kleptocracy, communist country, junta, or theocracy. You are essentially funding the dictatorship and suffering there.Totally agree.We've canceled all of our American vacations as well, just not worth it. *please come to Orlando you'll love it and thanks for the tourism money*[Guess you've can't go to Ireland, Japan, or Estonia either.](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016#table) Or France. Or Poland. Or Portugal. Or Spain. Or the Czech Republic. Or South Korea. Or Hungary. Or Italy. Or South Africa. Or...I didn't mention anything about corruption. Thanks, US doesn't really need any more self righteous assholes coming over here.Yeah, we already have enough of them here that we cannot get rid ofThere is a shit ton of money to be made there. I can see how that is attractive for those in the right lines of work.Slavery is still everywhere, unfortunately. I wouldn’t skip Dubai over it. But I wouldn’t go around touching dudes on the hip unless he was absolutely irresistible.So much human trafficking as well. Spent a few days there courtesy of the US Navy. Anyway, so many guys were talking about this great bar with a bunch of hot women.It was a Russia bar with what looked to be sex slaves... and over priced drinks.For reals, I'll never understand going to places like this with obvious shit for laws.Because these people are fucking rich, that's all. And they maintain that illusion of modernity with fucked up middle age style barbaric laws. Plenty of people party there, do drugs or alcohol, not understanding the risk they are taking. And Plenty of people get raped or go to prison as well, being a westerner will NOT save you.For me, it's more about not financially supporting these terrible places. I have a couple friends who've gone there, and yeah, their Instagram feeds looked awesome, but I lost a bit of respect for them.I know someone, when told about blood/conflict diamonds, who pretty much just shrugged it off and still said they insist on a diamond ring when they get engaged.Man, I don't think I could lose more respect for people who insist on diamonds even after being told everything.For the uninitiated:1) international diamond supply is overtly controlled by a cartel, the De Boers group.2) They have no problem trafficking diamonds which are obtained through child slavery. 3) They artificially reduce supply by hoarding diamonds, so there's more economic incentive for the blood diamond trade to continue. 4) Diamond engagement rings were a marketing scheme, thought up in the first place by--you guessed it--De Boers and pushed onto people through Hollywood pop culture. 5) Diamonds are instrinsically almost worthless. Their supply is artificially constrained as above, and it is tremendously easier to create them than mine them. And diamonds which aren't brand new from a De Boers dealer rapidly depreciate in value, making them an awful investment. 6) They are inferior gemstones to things like Moissanite, which has the same colour but superior statistics in every aspect a gem can have, except hardness. Which doesn't matter for jewelry.TL/DR: Fuck diamonds. Fuck diamond sellers, and fuck diamond buyers.&gt; International diamond supply is overtly controlled by a cartel, the De Boers group...&gt;... you guessed it--De Boers...&gt; ...new from a De Boers dealerDiamonds are [De Beers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers).Not unrelated are South African farmers called [Boer](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer).Philosophically, these two groups are far, far apart.&gt; Diamonds are instrinsically almost worthless.Industrial grade machining diamonds are necessarily very expensive.However, I generally agree some gem in a finger ring is worth fuck all.Edit: I missed the above poster's point: Do not buy things for which someone has suffered producing.After doing research bought a 2 carot moisanite engagement ring for my fiance for about 2000 dollars it blows any diamond ring out of the water with its brilliance and fire.Oh and for about 20 pct of the price. Everyone just assumes its a diamond and I spend 10k on it.Right on man!"Happy Wife, Happy Life."Is this **all** diamonds or specific diamonds? Virtually all natural diamonds. There are also lab-grown diamonds. And I'd like to point out that diamonds are not intrinsically worthless. They are the hardest natural substances and have plenty of industrial applications.These days it's not that hard to source [conflict free diamonds](https://www.theknot.com/content/the-scoop-on-conflict-free-diamonds). You have to do a little homework, because supply chains can get a little grey and not all dealers are the most honest/ethical, but they're out there.I saw a documentary that traced conflict free diamonds to the same supplier of non conflict free diamonds.Man made diamonds are better quality, always labeled as artificial and never related to conflictI went there for work. I've been lucky enough to travel all over the world for my job. There has been no place that I've visited in my travels where I was more excited to go than I was after being there... except Dubai.Don't go there, the place sucks. Imagine all the opulent commercial garbage that you hate about Vegas, and then subtract all the fun that makes up for it.Only place in the world that I've been and never want to go back to.Charges have been dropped due to intervention by the ruler of the emirate of Dubai. Most likely because of bad international press that would hurt tourism etc http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-41722204We should have an "It list" for safe/normal/sane places to travel, and a "Shit list" for every place elsePeople not "from the West" don't enjoy being raped either.I could wonder why the wealthy aren't literally torn apart in the streets by raving mobs of their slaves.But then I would have to wonder why it doesn't happen in the US either.Easy. Because they pay people like them decent money (compared to the actual proles) to brandish guns against them.In certain middle easter states, the most feared ones are the foreign mercenaries because they have absolutely no qualms about opening machine gun fire on a protesting mob. Not as much as someone from the same community, at least.people from anywhere. they treat people from East Asia and Europe like shit, treat Indians and Filipinos like slaves. i don't know anything about being black there but that's probably not a good thing either. they're cunts and the fact that they live in a crappy desert for the rest of their lives gives me some solace. also the fact that they come over (to the US) and get rocked for being a money tree makes me feel pretty good too. their ticket and lawsuit moneys fund our cities and their purchase of supercars fund our companies not theirs. But then why are we importing people who help create and maintain that culture to the West?  Eventually, there will be nowhere for Westerners to go.  As a woman, I do worry about that. I worry that there are places you shouldn't go alone or after dark. I worry that rapists are pardoned and released because "sexual emergencies" are now a thing.  I worry that men can pose as boys to be taken into families, and dentists can be fired and harassed for proving that they are lying about their ages.  I worry that cops now have "no go zones."Maybe we could try judging immigrants as individuals instead of hating people based on where they were born?Or we could judge people based on all the facts? Because your culture, lifestyle and background are basic information for any travel, visa or immigration application. No, nationality is not a reason to ban someone but it is prudent to weigh nationality along with many dozens of other factors.Wow, way to dismiss OP's reasonable concern and try to paint her as some racist bigot. The failed regressive left really has nothing left, do they?Your response is infantile and retarded. The problem is not one of individuals, it is one of masses, of statistics, of simple numbers. Nobody says that every single individual immigrant is a bad person because of where they come from. But when you look at immigrants from particular countries or regions as a whole, and you see some alarming statistics about their beliefs when it comes to terrorism, women, homosexuals, democracy, secularism, etc., then it's perfectly reasonable to wish to stop immigration from those places. It's not that every immigrant is bad, it's that the immigration as a whole is detrimental to citizens.Saying we should judge people by their merits not by where they are born is "infantile and retarded"? What? It's almost like that guy is infantile and retarded...In theory, I agree with you. However, when a large majority (something like 70%) of Somalis and Syrians believe Sharia should be the law, how do you find only those who don't?Sharia prescribes punishments like stoning for rape victims and cutting off hands for theft. Do you believe this system has any place in the modern world?Where are you getting your statistics from? I would imagine that number is vastly exaggeratedTake the example of Indonesia (which is widely considered to be a moderate Muslim nation) from the data in the link above. * 72% believe Sharia should be the law of the land.* 54% believe it is the literal word of God.* 50% believe it should be applicable to non-Muslims too (there goes your tolerance toward other religions)* 45% favor corporal punishment like cutting off hands* 48% favor stoning for adultery (only for the woman, though)* 18% favor death to anyone who wants to renounce IslamI'm not worried about Islamic fundamentalists who go around blowing people up (you're statistically more likely to be kicked to death by a donkey than killed by a terrorist). I'm worried about the average Muslim from these nations who wants to take the world back to the dark ages.I feel bad judging a Muslim individual before I've met them. However, being unbiased works only when religious nutjobs are a very small fraction of your society, not 70%.&amp;nbsp;[Source - Pew research center](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/)I was wondering if Pew is reliable and unbiased. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/3sv9a0/is_pew_research_a_reliable_source_of_information/) thread seems to indicate it is.Hmm if only there was a way to figure out how people feel about "women, homosexuals, democracy, secularism"? Maybe we could ask them? Nah that's too hard let's just go off their skin color. /sUnrelated, I find your example of "women, homosexuals, democracy, secularism" funny since those are all things that conservatives hate.Bingo. It's not even like we import these people for fun. Most are either fleeing life endangering situations, or have skills that they can use in the countries they are going to.&gt;  why are we importing peopleWe do not 'import people'. They pass through a strict immigraton process.&gt;who help create and maintain that culture to the West? Yeah, like electing people who brag about grabbing young women by the pussy?*And they let you do it*"Look at us. We're the puritans who bully and attack consenting adults for what they choose to do in the bedroom now."Don't you have to go defend the heroes of the left, Bill Clinton, Anthony Weiner, and the whole cast and crew of Hollywood perverts and rapitss and pedofiles now?Lol no one fuckin defends Anthony Weiner. You make shit up about the left and then start to believe it. You guys are a special bunch. There are some places people ~~from the West~~ shouldn't go.ftfyThe guy worked in Afghanistan and was there on a layover. But anyways, he's no longer sentences.Can the opposite be trueSo a Scottish man goes to jail while touching the hip of an "Arab man" (almost certainly a local Emirati), while the local Emiratis get away with rapes because they blame the victim for "seducing" them, and they even get away with committing the most revolting, repulsive and violent rapes imaginable. Most people have no idea how bad and unjust the UAE is; words won't do it justice so I will just go straight into examples. While you read this massive post, just keep in mind the whole time that a man went to jail for just touching an Emirati man. Now look at what the local Emiratis get up to: 4 Emirati men kidnapped an Ethiopian maid, gang-raped her twice in different locations, then ran her over with a car and then proceeded to stone her to death with large rocks which smashed her skull into pieces. After paying 200k dirhams ($50k) "blood money" in total (so around $12.5k each, a few months salary for an Emirati), they were released from prison. One of the attackers 13 years prior had raped and murdered a Pakistani little girl, but her father who was an imam forgave him.So just to be clear, 4 Emirati men, one of whom was already a known rapist and murderer, gang raped and then brutally murdered an Ethiopian housemaid, smashing her skull into pieces, and they were released after paying just over $10k each. Because in the UAE foreign victims are practically forced into accepting blood money by their lawyers (always Emirati), none of them received their sentence. This was the "Al Dhaid murder", I strongly insist people look it up because it's even worse than you think. Search "Al Dhaid murder" on google for a proper set of results on how serious it was, it's even more grotesque than you think. So basically, this disgusting crime is not as bad as just normal consensual sex because as we know, Emiratis can do no wrong.Here's a story of how a French 15 year old teenage boy "Alex" was gang-raped by 3 Emirati men and it turns out that they gave him HIV/AIDS. Anyway, before outcry from human rights groups, it was he, rather than the rapists, that was arrested and blamed. The boy was actually quite lucky his mother was well connected with the diplomatic circles otherwise like the vast majority of other cases he would have been jailed for being raped.http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/world/middleeast/01dubai.htmlA doctor examined Alex the night of the rape, taking swabs of DNA for traces of the rapists’ sperm. He did not take blood tests or examine Alex with a speculum. Then he cleared the room and told Alex: “I know you’re a homosexual. You can admit it to me. I can tell.” Alex told his father in tears: “I’ve just been raped by three men, and he’s saying I’m a homosexual,” according to interviews with both of them. The doctor, an Egyptian, wrote in his legal report that he had found no evidence of forced penetration, which Alex’s family says is a false assessment that could hurt the case against the assailants.In early September, after the family learned about the older attacker’s H.I.V. status and the French government lodged complaints with the United Arab Emirates authorities, the Dubai attorney general’s office assigned a new prosecutor to the case. Only then were forensic tests performed to confirm that sperm from all three attackers had been found in Alex.Alex stayed in Dubai in order to testify against his attackers, and went back to school in September, despite suffering unsettling flashbacks. In early October, however, the family said, their lawyer warned Alex that he was in danger of facing charges of homosexuality and a prison term of one year.http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/world/middleeast/01dubai.htmlThere was another case involving a French girl where an Emirati singer, Saoud Abou Sultan, lured the girl to his room, spiked her drink and gang-raped her with others while she was unconscious. She woke up in the middle of the desert found by a police officer and apparently she had bruises all over her stomach and private parts. Anyway the most shocking thing about this was that Saoud Abou Sultan, being an Emirati, was not convincted of rape but for "consensual sex". He did receive 6 months of jail time which is impressive for a local who usually get nothing, but it was only because of "consensual sex" not rape. How the fuck is spiking a girl's drink, gang-raping her and dumping her in the desert consensual"? Is that worth 6 months in jail?Rape victims, usually maids, are arrested for "seduction" or "extramarital sex" in the UAE while the rapist Emiratis have impunity: https://news.vice.com/article/rape-victims-are-being-jailed-under-extramarital-sex-laws-in-the-uae One BBC article apparently showed a rape victim being chained up after revealing her rape: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/hundreds-of-women-prosecuted-for-extramarital-sex-in-uae-finds-bbc Apparently one Ethiopian servant who was raped was arrested and when they found she was pregnant, chained her to the hospital bed to prevent her from absconding from her crime of being raped.Another recent story in the UAE where an Emirati woman gruesomely tortured an Indonesian maid for months and then starved her to death. The police recovered her starved, battered and bruised body with torture marks everywhere and found blood stains all over the house. They then realized the Emirati woman had been torturing and starving maids for a decade but they did not punish her or even arrest her, because the maids did not end up dead. Only when the Emirati finally managed to starve a maid to death did the Emirati police bother arresting her. There was a similar case which happened slightly before, where an Emirati tortured an African woman to death after months of abuse. Neighbours siad they heard screams and wails for months through the walls. Read it: http://www.emirates247.com/crime/local/woman-starves-maid-to-death-dubai-court-told-2016-02-26-1.622369Another case of what Emiratis are allowed to do with impunity: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/24/the-vanished-filipino-domestic-workers-working-abroad“My employer was like a lion with no mercy,” she says. Marina says she was forced to work 22 hours a day without rest. She woke at 4am to start cleaning the family’s fleet of cars and worked through to 2am the following morning. “I had no time off, no time to rest ever. Even when I was trying to eat, she would be calling me: ‘You are not here to rest. I paid a lot of money for you.’ To her, I was a slave. I was not a human.”After a month of working constantly on two hours sleep and little food, Marina’s health was deteriorating fast. She lost sensation in the right half of her body and couldn’t use her hands. “I was so tired it felt like I couldn’t control my brain. After a few weeks I was in so much pain, I couldn’t walk or lift anything. I didn’t know if my children were OK. I felt so alone.”Yet her female Emirati employer told her, ‘You can’t go back to the Philippines because I paid money for you,’” Marina says. She claims her employer threatened to get her sent to jail, or kill her, and screamed that she would dump her in the desert. “She told me, ‘If I killed you, nobody would care and nobody would find you.’ I said, ‘Madam, if you want to kill me, go ahead.’” After this, Marina says, her boss tried to poison her. The husband of the house then threatened to beat her with a baton, and locked her in a prayer room for three days and nights with no food or water.“I would just say to anyone who is thinking of going to work abroad, don’t trust anyone,” she says. “They will kill you and nobody will do anything to help.”https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/24/the-vanished-filipino-domestic-workers-working-abroadIn short what I am trying to say is that if you are not an Emirati, you are a subhuman slave to them, a beast of burden. The Gulf states are truly the most racist and dehumanizing places on earth for non-locals. Anyone who has lived in the Arab world for more than a few months knows full well that many of them genuinely and sincerely do not view migrant workers from Asia/Africa as fully human and treat them as animals. E.g. http://www.99media.org/slavery-in-the-arab-world/ "The host, the mother of my acquaintance, reeled around laughing. "This is not a human being, she [her maid] is an animal and will be treated as such" Sometimes the level of prejudice is actually quite amusing because it's so farcical. For instance (and if you don't believe me on this, ask anyone who has lived in the Gulf), the way the police figure out who is responsible for a crime is not based on evidence but based on nationality. So for instance, if an Emirati man crashes into the car of an expat or migrant worker etc, that would be the fault of the expat because he's not Emirati and the former would be arrested. Always remember these incidents before you go to Dubai. Or just don't go at all. Don't give these kinds of people your money. Make sure people know things like this happen.*crosses Dubai off of list of cool places to go visit*Dubai would be a cool place to visit if you got rid of all the people living in it.A macabre experience to drift like the ghosts of victims among the vacant monuments to Mammon and Moloch.Maybe a cool place to visit if you're into horror.I'll visit Dubai as soon as its highest spires are barely above the sand dunes.The desert can't be defeated, only slowed down.Bunch of fucking degenerates.It's a disgusting backwards culture. Without oil, they'd still be living in the stone age.Gross culture.Tl;Dr. Most of Middle East is inhospitable shithole.Not if you are rich and evil, then it's paradise.Unless you hate the heat. Then you can just build an Antarctic base.From Lebanon, I am sorry for the people involved. Please don't take this as a representation of arab culture as a whole. We do not associate with the animals of the gulf and are nothing like them. Again I am so sorry and hope that some how the world will stop its addiction to oil so that the subhuman actions of the gulf people may finally lead to their appropriate punishmentDon't worry, anyone with half an education knows that not all Arabs or Arab countries are the same. The Gulf states are pretty unique in their exploitation of foreigners. Unfortunately, there are going to be less educated people who say shitty things to you for being Arab/Muslim. Not all Arabs are the same - but it seems like every single one that walks into my restaurants and bars are just the worst type of people. Rude, condescending and most of all, cheap as fuck. I always give Arabs top notch service because I can at least walk away knowing I did the best job possible and these people didn’t tip/insulted me because they’re pieces of human garbage.Persians, Lebanese and Qataris are generally speaking, some of the best guests I’ve ever had...   but Arabs can get fucked; there’s something seriously wrong with that culture and I have zero desire to see that part of the world based on the people I’ve met from there.Thank nothing further than the US for putting these fucks into dictatorship. Of course, "We the US" is ally with Saudi Arabia. Uh huh. Don't hear feminists railing off about the fact they're going to be "allowed to drive next year sometime".Face it, the Middle East is a shithole and cesspool. And US policies have put the very people in power. Then again, look who the US put into power...We aren’t the only country that supported coupes in the Middle East. You can also blame Germany, Russia, the UK and South American countries. Basically anyone with money and military power.The sooner we stop relying on oil and this country's economy collapses the better.Holy actual fuck do they need some freedom They buy and sell our freedom. Because we keep sucking their dicks for oil.Strongly agreed. It needs to be freedom through education, not invasion. That's uhhh, not what Americans good at, so we're gonna push for the latter.These stories are horrifying. Omg... And don't let these kind of people in your country. They will rape your women and children. In before mods lock this news story like they did the one from last week about the girl getting sexually assaulted 3 times in one night by migrants.Gotta keep the agenda going.I wouldn't mind an Arab Dexter to clean up Dubai . . . and many other places.Vacation paradise my rosy red rectum.I’m gonna report you for advertising!!Also, is it self catering or are meals included? Is there Wi-Fi? And it better be rosy and red!And rectum-like. Dubai makes a lot of money on tourism. If you go to Dubai for fun/vacation you are supporting their laws.Thats fucked up...Dubai and all arab man walk around holding hands They are showing the world how not gay they are.   I find it interesting that the places on the planet with the most animosity towards gays are the places that have the highest rate of gay porn streaming.That's because there's probably the same amount of gay men in those areas as elsewhere but have no other outlet for their preference.Like Utah.People say that the southerners in the US are the most racist and yet statistics show that is where most of interracial porn is streamed as well.It's important to know that if lost in the Middle East, it's common for a man hold your hand when helping you find your way. But don't squeeze back, that's gay.Actually i saw plenty of times that there are indian men walking in Dubai holding hands. But as i was told later, that's not gay, that's just how best friends walk. Weird as for me, but i guess it works for them.For god sake stop going to that bigoted and misogynistic shit hole.Why the fuck do people go there? It's just a mountain of shit painted in gold.Because people like gold no matter how much it would stink, seriously, that's basically Dubai. Loads of western prostitutes go there for instance, to get pissed on,shat on and gang raped by rich Emirati.Keep in mind that the ordinary person doesn't know anything about the laws and human rights situation in these countries.There is a lot of UAE/Qatar propaganda in the western media,advertising it as a glamourous and modern vacation destination, you can't blame people take a vacation over there, most of them just don't know better.It boggles my mind to think of going to another country without doing any research first.Wait so they serve beer in Dubai but it’s illegal to drink it? I’m confused I'm gonna guess he was drinking in a public place, which is illegal in Dubai, but the article conveniently leaves out the details.I was in Dubai a couple of months ago, drinking beer in a hotel bar with no issues whatsoever.The article said he was drinking at "Rock Bottom bar in Dubai." It was unclear from the article whether the bar is in a hotel. But it wasn't a public place, like a park or the street.So how it is legal for the bar to sell alcohol but illegal for its patrons to drink alcohol?  I, too, am confused.Never get out of the boatSo, never go to Dubai!I honestly don’t know why anyone would risk going to the UAE. My gf couldn't understand why i insisted on paying extra to avoid a layover in Dubai.  I am not going to jail for a poppy seed bagel or some stupid shit.i probably wouldnt understand either, when youre in a layover youre not in the actual country where you leave the airport and set foot out, you're just in the airport waiting for the next flight.and nothing happened to me when i was in a 6 hour layover.Did you go through customs?Why I don't go to even the "nice" middle east countries 101.Why the fuck anyone goes to Dubai voluntarily is far fucking beyond me. If there's any place on earth that can be said to have an objectively shitty and filthy culture, through and through, it's fucking Dubai.Qatar is worsePeople see big buildings and cool car and big malls and think it sounds fun. I think they're stupid, but it's easy to see why it could be appealing.It's so they can arrest whoever they feel like when they wantThe entire middle easti think its saudi arabia, dubai is way more tame compared to them.How many times does shit like this have to happen?  Don't vacation in the middle east, they do not like you there, do not want you there, and will go out of their way to make problems for you.   I've been, I can attest from personal experience myself.Update:  All charges dropped.  http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-41722204There’s not one Muslim majority country I’d like to go to. Indonesia? Morocco? Turkey? Malaysia?Granted, I wouldn't want to live in most of those countries, but plenty are fine to visit and most are conflict free.I’ve heard great things about Morocco Egypt was nice before the Muslim Brotherhood took over It's Papa sisi nowI'd like to go to Indonesia.  Maybe Lebanon too.  Malaysia was fine, they have lots Chinese and Indian people to keep things well rounded, though Muslims are like 60% of the population.Yeah all the rest are right out thanks.  from my experience: Jordan , morocco, Tunis , turkey , Malaysia , Lebanon were a wonderful visit.lost of friendly people and beautiful scenery and so many things to explore.He better not complain about it onlineAnother religious monarchy that needs to be snuffed out.How many times do you need to read these stories to understand not to go to these places.  They are T-R-A-S-H.  I don't think I've ever heard a compelling enough reason to visit Dubai.Dubai should burn down.Been in and out of Dubai since 2008....the place is an onion. For fuck's sake. I've said it before, evidently I'll have many opportunities to say it again: DO NOT GO TO DUBAI.How is he being charged with drinking alcohol if they sell it at the bar?I have no clue why anyone would want to go on holiday in the middle east.I don't feel pity for anyone who goes to Dubai anymore.You *know* they're a bunch of backwards camel-fuckers.  It's on you at this point.Shouldn't the man who was touched be stoned for being too enticing for the Scotsman? My thought is that the man in the bar might have being wearing that new cologne Ovis. Don't go to Muslim countries..... problem solvedSeems I can't properly reply to this without breaking almost every rule the moderators have set on this subreddit.    Maybe I can boil it down to one single word without having my post removed. Here we go:     CavemenStay away from the Middle East ..I've always said I would love to go to Dubai but never will, for the fear of getting arrested for something stupid Definition of ridiculous. 1. Tips for working in a situation like Dubai..  Keep your head down and do your job.2. Be courteous but don't try to make friends with natives. It's not that they are bad people but they have different standards from Westernesse. We are cultural aliens and it's too easy to violate a taboo innocently.3. If you love alcohol or alcohol loves you too much don't go. Dubai or booze. Pick one.* GTFO and take your loot. Be a tourist somewhere else. I'm I the only one who thinks we are not getting the whole story here? There must be more involved than "putting his hand on his hip" According to other reports the Scot groped the other guy but the victim then withdrew the accusation but local law enforcement pursued it.However, charges have just been dropped after the ruler of the Emirate of Dubai intervened.The 2 above points give evidence that it really was a small event blown out of proportion. https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-scotland-tayside-central-41722204No he hasn't.http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/23/559474630/dubai-jails-then-frees-scottish-tourist-over-touching-man-in-a-barDon't do gay shit in a place where you get jailed for it. If there were a place where heterosexual behavior was punished by jail time, I'd say don't do hetero shit in a place where you get jailed for it. For fucks sake people. Damn a month for drinking beer and he's fighting a case for making a rude gesture??  Thats just called going to a bar in America 😮There are always two sides to a story...http://m.gulfnews.com/news/uae/courts/drunk-visitor-jailed-for-groping-man-at-pub-1.2110566Top visiting this piece of shit countryIt's not that hard to google up a bit about the laws and what not to do about place you are going to. And then maybe decide not to go there.I thought they weren’t allowed to drink?Why anyone ever goes to Dubai on vacation completely bewildered me. The place sounds like a sketchy uptight fucking mess. The d&amp;b DJ Grooverider once got a year in prison there for having something like 0.1g of Marijuana found in his luggage. Like tiny crumbs. Visiting Dubai to play a show and he gets a year in prison. The place is completely fucked. Psst...hey everyone... I have a great LPT for you all: stop going to fucked up countries. I'm gonna see this as evidence that Dubai men are all closeted gays, trying to avoid the slightest contact with other men lest it lead to a spontaneous erection, rape because they can't control themselves even a little, then 'honor' killing of their friend's sisters, because Dubai men take no responsibility for anything.Fuck Dubai and the camels and goats the men there grind in on. The world sees you as backwards, depraved, without honor and barely human.Your oil will run out, and your tourism schemes will fail as more and more people discover your human (and animal) rights abuses. Within 50 years, the wealthiest among you will be prostituting their children for food.Edit: I'm not trying to conflate gay men with Dubai men. Most Dubai men are rapists.I'm actually planning a trip out of the country, any Muslim country or any country that is in the Middle East I have taken off that list. I don't understand why other people don't do the same. I will never be able to see Egypt thoughHe's been released after intervention by the King.How nice of him.... ಠ_ಠ
It's just strange because Texas has a fucking express lane for executions. If they could some how implement a self checkout system they'd probably jump on it.No, they would jump off it.No no. There is a trap door that opens beneath you. No jumping is requiredYeah, they kinda need to sort this out before executing Shore...Let's be frank, his lawyer screwed him over.Swearingen is a cocksucker.I can't think of any quotes from Deadwood besides Mr. Woo repeatedly saying "cocksucker."I hope the guy gets found innocent if he didn't kill that poor girl. He's a serial killer so...No, the other dude is. This guy is only there on one murder for which they have no physical evidence and which had similarities to the murders by the serial killer. Well then! I retract my commenti didnt read it. was the strange twist that hes not actually guility? that actually happens alot. This inmate, Swearinger is accused of colluding with another inmate, to have that inmate take the fall for the murder Swearinger is to be executed for. The other inmate is serial killer who has murdered 5 people. So, I guess the thinking is 'well the other guy is going to be executed anyways, so maybe he can claim he killed the woman I was convicted of murdering, that way I can get away with it and get out of prison'. Swearinger's lawyer denies the claim. The serial killer has not taken 'credit' for that murder, yet. But apparently they need to investigate the possible collusion. I didn't read your reply. Was it something about the strange twist from the article? Was the accused actually undergoing sex assignment surgery at the time of the murder or something? That could happen.ha. half assed plans by inmates who have nothing else to do then collude . i dont see how that would ever get over in any world. especially not this one  .oh hes in texas too? na. hes going down regardless.  i guess i dont exactly find that a strange twist. inmates all over the us talk the same shit day in day out . its like they get no help in prison whatsoever. ungreatful wards of the state. Put down the bong and try reading. It's good for you.Pick up the bong and try reading Pass the bong and I'll read it to you.
That one with the underwear is a deranged *madman* and it is very important he does not get released free ever again.yeah. he fucked himself. when u try to blow up a plane you lose your chance at anything. fuck this guyFuck this guy.  They can feed him dirt for all I care.  He has harmed our country nearly as much as anyone.  It’s his fault we all have to walk barefoot in an airport and put up with security theater.  Remember when it was just shoe bombers we had to worry about?Totally. After having to take my shoes off then hearing about this guy I wasn’t looking forward to my next flight LOL.Abdulmutallab sounds like the real name of some prescription pill, LOL.Humira is actually Adalimumab, for example.Every time we fly we get our rights violated because of you, you phony creep. Shut up.
&gt;Wesley Mathews, 37, told police he had checked on Sherin about 15 minutes after allegedly sending her out of their home - only to find her gone.&gt;He told the police he had returned to the house and "did a load of laundry" as he was not too worried.That doesn't makes sense when you consider his following statement about coyotes.&gt;About five hours later, after sunrise, he called the authorities to report her missing.Five hours!?! &gt;He also said he had seen coyotes in the alley near where he told her to stand.A convenient explanation, to be sure. And if it were true, then he deliberately placed her in harms way at the very least.I suspect he killed her and hid her body in the drain. Hopefully, an autopsy will reveal the truth.
Using water will only spread the toxic chemicals into the river nearby so they will let it burn and go into the atmosphere for everyone to breath....
It is used to prevent sparks, They make all types of blast media. I have used Walnut hulls, Sodium Bicarbonate, Coal Slag, Copper Slag, Plastic beads, Gravel, and every form of Silica sand from Glass beads to river sand. It is called PPE, use it or that job will kill you. Breathing any pulverized material is never good. To be fair he wasn't the one blasting not was blasting being done at the time. Blasting had been done previously and he was doing air quality checks at the site. PPE for that would depend on department procedures but this is like that shit where someone touches a table a peanut butter sandwich was made on earlier that day and goes into anaphylactic shock.If you're checking to see if they air is safe to breathe, breathing the air is not the way to do it.Unless the equipment which is used to detect the lead paint said it was safe to breathe and you take off the hot as shit mask or you are checking a specific room in a building go to a different room to remove your ppe and get ready to leave or shells get dragged into a separate part of the building by he workers who sand blasted and weren't cleaned up or literally any number of scenarios plausible for an allergy so extreme that tiny particulates in the air triggered a lethal anaphylactic shock. I mean details will come out after occupational safety investigation but it's a little silly to just magically assume the guy was an idiot for not expecting tree nuts on a site that was "sand" blasted and assuming he didn't do things correctly before any evidence of that comes outdid your read the article?  he wasn't the one doing the blasting.  &gt;He was there to test the air quality because another company had just been inside sandblasting old lead paint off the walls.the question is if he was aware that they were using walnut shell media. edit, thinking about this more;There is also the question of how long is the dust dangerous.  If you’re blasting indoors you can expect dust to settle in areas that may not be cleaned.  If in ten years some allergy prone person is hanging birthday decorations and knocks some dust off of the rafters will they be in danger?Good post. I too have used multiple media but never without proper mask and suit. &gt; 500 people attended his funeral.Wow, I'll be lucky if I have 10 people at my funeral.  Really sad all the way around.If no one comes to my funeral, then I'm not going to theirs. That'll show 'em!Similar to the reason im not inviting my parents to my wedding, they didnt invite me to theirsI prefer to have friends that have better things to do then look at an urn I'm in.&gt;David was told walnut shells are now being used in sandblasting because it’s environmentally friendly and **healthier for workers** than the silica sand used traditionally.Healthier for workers unless they happen to be among the ~1% of people with tree nut allergies.They were blasting walls to remove lead paint, and the allergic individual was the one checking to see if all the lead dust had settled, something he shouldn't have been doing without a self contained breathing apparatus in the first place. And the alternative to using walnut shells is to give people lung cancer by using silica. So which would you personally prefer?The silica, obviously, since it's non-discriminatory. ^/sSeems like he would prefer people find out what they're allergic to and avoid those things. Why is reddit always so adversarial? Every other fucking response. Does everybody come here looking for a fight? Is it because we're mostly Americans and we all hate each other and everybody and ourselves? This site should switch to walnut shells, because it's cancer. Seemed like a reasonable discussion until your vitriolic rant, honestly.TeslaAddict's post used hostile wording. Probably unintentional.", something he shouldn't have been doing without a self contained breathing apparatus in the first place."He is assuming all kinds of things to make an ad hom attack on the individual.No you see the narrative now is that if you disagree or have a different opinion you're a violent misogynist. Not productive. If you are hearing that a lot, then you are probably a violent misogynist.Spotted the violent misogynist!Probably because the majority of Americans have no access to affordable healthcare and that test costs too fucking much. Fuck America. Well I know what the dead guy would've chosen...Except the testing had said the room was clear of lead. At that point, people take it off. I didn't know walnuts where used in sand blasting.the man doing the lead testing is the one who died from the allergy. Do you even read?That poor dude... The nut allergy thing in US will never stop amazing me. What is it with you people?... In Russia I've never heard of anybody with a nut allergy so severe... It's never a plot piece in a TV show or a movie.. Same with Israel.EDIT: Took me a few hours and some help to realize that this happened in Canada.About half of.my point stands I guessIt's due to a multitude of reasons but the biggest issue probably is the failure to expose the child to allergens early in life. Failure during birth to expose their baby to the mothers feces and or vaginal discharge, both of which are needed to jumpstart the babies immune system. It should be noted that, specific to nut allergies, medical advice in the '90s through mid '00s was to delay introducing nuts to children as much as possible. Current medical advice on the other hand is to introduce nuts, especially peanuts, early and often - even if the child shows signs of being sensitive (but does not yet have a dangerous reaction) to nuts. As a 22 year old with a peanut and tree nut allergy this is very true. Medical advice is complete 180 now and everyone from my generation has to live with itWhoa! Interesting.In israeli press I read, that what prevents nut allergies in the country is Bamba - the most popular in Israel snack, peanut-falvoured puffed maize. Kids eat it since probly the age of 2 and until finishing the army service :DThis about allergens. It is probably true about peanuts. I dont have a link for you though.The second half I have never heard before..."Failure during birth to expose their baby to the mothers feces and or vaginal discharge, both of which are needed to jumpstart the babies immune system."Please take you bullshit elsewhere.You are the one who is full of shit by the way. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3110651/Different geographic regions have different allergens that impact people. For example, while rice allergy is rare in the west it’s the most common grain allergy in east Asia. I don’t know anyone allergic to sesame but in the Middle East sesame is one of the big good allergy triggers. This was in Canada.Imagine being born in Canada and being allergic to maple syrup.  That would suck.He died because he was allergic, not because the walnut particles infested his lugs and ruined them, as I assumed was the case from the title of the article.Dry Ice and lasers are the safest methodsYou still have to think about what you’re blasting off the surface. No matter the removal method, proper protective gear is essential.They need to change the name from sand blasting to nut busting... But walnuts are all natural and the internet says all natural means it's good! I bet they used the GMO walnuts.Yes, I AM being sarcastic.I heard they were non-GMO Organic walnut shells.  Because, you know, organic walnut shells absorb the lead paint better.&gt;He was there to test the air quality because another company had just been inside sandblasting old lead paint off the walls.Well, at least he did his job. Now we know its not safe&gt;His sisters would like to see EpiPens be more readily available. They don’t know where Justin’s was at the time he entered the fire hall, and the firefighters that tried to help him did not have one on hand.It's crazy to me that first responders do not carry EpiPens when first responders in some areas carry Narcan to reverse heroine overdoses. Seems like allergic reactions are so commonplace the their would be great benefits for first responders to carry EpiPens. I'm typically against "safe space" restrictions on allergens. That being said, I don't think you should be allowed to spray nut particles into the air like that. This is the allergy equivalent of a smoker contributing to people dying around them. Sand is cheap and in great quantity worldwide. We shouldn't be exchanging that for stuff that can kill a portion of the population.The alternative is silica media which causes lung cancer. Everything in life is a tradeoff.Silicosis not cancer True, but it too is debilitating and often deadly.Any sand which causes issues for anybody is a problem. Spraying allergens in the air which everyone shares is ultimately not a right any company has.If they want to do so then that's fine but they are still legally liable for not taking precautions around that.&gt; Spraying allergens in the air which everyone sharesMedia blasting is generally only done in enclosed areas, not out in the general public. You are fearmongering. Google "sand blast cabinet".  This instance was a special case because they were blasting walls to remove lead paint, and the allergic individual was the one checking to see if all the lead dust had settled, something he shouldn't have been doing without a self contained breathing apparatus in the first place.&gt;Media blasting is generally only done in enclosed areas, not out in the general public.This guy walked into a building to test the air quality after the spraying had been done. He then died as a result of inhaling what was left over. He wasn't walking through a building or a space during a sand blasting.&gt;On Oct. 2, Justin Mathews went to work at the Rossdale fire station. He was there to test the air quality because another company had just been inside sandblasting old lead paint off the walls.&gt;His family said he was inside the building for about 20 minutes when he started having trouble breathing, walked outside and collapsed.Next time, read the article before you start presenting theories about what happened.I did. You didn't read the rest of my comment.The funny thing is, neither of you seem to understand anything about lead testing.They were blasting lead off tge walls and creating airborne lead dust. This guy was the inspector who going in to check the air quality... He should have been wearing a fucking mask and tank.&gt; *Next time, read the article...*Sir, you speak heresy.Such conduct as you promote is not tolerated here.No, the alternative is to put a fucking sign up.And it doesn't cause lung cancer.&gt; *Sand is cheap and in great quantity worldwide.*Sand is NOT in any way comparable.Sand creates a rough, pitted surface. It leaves smooth die-cast aluminum a ready receptacle for dirt and grease that cannot be removed without more blasting.It's been decades since I last used it, but Walnut shell blasting won't remove baked-on paint IIRC, but everything else will be gone and with a nice smooth surface.In fact, that's WHY walnut shell blasting is used over sand or glass beads.[deleted]&gt;Sand is one of the cheapest substances on the planet.Sand costs about $50 metric per ton. If you're genuinely arguing that this isn't an economical material, you're simply arguing for the sake of arguing.Which is fine. We have the option of choosing to be the **contrarian** but that doesn't mean you're actually saying something of value.I'm a contractorYour values are seriously wrongSilica sand cost $10-12/ cubic foot= 100 lbsSh-t I wish I could buy it for $50/ tonne or even per ton.And it is not used for sand blasting on site any ore, been banned for decades You're a contractor who apparently doesn't know how to purchase products in bulk.http://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/6207-fracking-makes-sand-the-new-hot-commodity-what-you-need-to-know?nopaging=1&gt;Back in 2008, most types of industrial silica sand cost an average of $30.82 per ton. By 2012, the price of such sand was an average of $44.78 per ton, with high-quality frac sand costing as much as $55 per ton. In 2013, the price of this high-quality sand rose to an average of average of $75 per metric ton.I was wrong about the $50 dollar price point but the original point still stands.You're likely purchasing something which brands itself as being of a higher quality. It's sand.[ I can shine a turd for you](http://www.humansarenotbroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mythbusters-shiny-poo-700x325.jpg) but you'd still be fucking yourself over for spending more than spare change on it.Reality vs articles. Lol own and operate a industrial waterjet. The sand that is needed for it is right under my feet, On the other side of the planet. Then storing/removal ect. Sand blasting also requires a particular medium, can not just run down to the beach or local gravel pit. You friggin idiot." It's sand."Do you think all sand is the same? that all rocks are the same?Even with the loosest reasonable definition, there are at least a dozen different types of sand, all with different course between silt and gravel.Saying "It's sand" is like saying "It's dirt."  Sand is a non renewable resource and we are running out. 
^oh ^no, ^who ^could ^have ^seen ^this ^coming?Will Meryl Streep give a speech defending him again?That’s the most disgusting aspect for me. The guy is a sicko, but to see the Hollywood culture lionize him is concerning. These people are seriously depraved. Makes you wonder, are so many people in Hollywood victims of sexual coercion that generally they are psychologically damaged in some way?  A middle aged woman giving that creep a standing ovation?  If something looks like crazy, that does.  The guy is a fugitive from justice for crying out loud.Also didn't someone say "it wasn't rape rape" as it was something not to be too concerned with? I had heard that but no idea who it was from.  &gt; "it wasn't rape rape"I believe that was Whoopi.  Totally concentual drugged anal sex was a 13 year old /sWhoopi Goldberg? I'll be damned.  Never expected Guinan to talk like that, wow what a blast from the past.  Loved that show.I am going to hope she was taken out of context or didn't really mean that it wasn't rape and was just explaining it technically.  I hate to think one of my TNGers was explaining that horrific act away, you can't consent as a drugged 13 year old, it's rape rape. no other way to interpret it. she meant what she said https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5FVssACWRMyoutube it. she even goes on to try downplay how people look at age. really really fucked upWow hollywood routed out anything considering brain matter with her.  That is just so sad.  Maybe she has always thought that way.  Good thing she hasn't been in the spotlight for so long then and no wonder if this is how they think.Don't worry, we still have national treasure Patrick Stuart. Here's the clip where she mentions rape rape then later in the clip talks about how it might be due to a cultural difference.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHflBPU-DtASo I watched this clip.  She is dead set on excusing this person.. I thought you were maybe stretching it somewhat.  She is dead set on it.  This has got to be the most heartbreaking thing I have seen in ages.  I never thought of her as a person that would be like this.    What is worse is I see she has a comfy regular job now as a host on a show, how?  How do we let people with views like this be our happy morning show hosts?  What in the hell is wrong with people!?!?!?&gt; Makes you wonder, are so many people in Hollywood victims of sexual coercion that generally they are psychologically damaged in some way? Damn, never thought of that. It’s like perpetuating the cycle. Passing it down, just like they were taught when getting in the door. I think that every time I hear a female actresses victim blame other women with things like "If you go to his hotel, you know what's going to happen" and even "If you're alone with him, you know what's going to happen". Like, damn, that paints a picture of something terrible that must have happened to you. This all started because the California judicial system broke all sorts of procedural rules to get him convicted.The guy should have been an open and shut case with a guilty criminal ruling. All the evidence was there.But then the judge and prosecutor started all sorts of unconstitutional actions to try to really put the boot in. Ex parte meetings. Retroactive revocation of plea bargain. A promise by the judge (whose jurisdiction was purely state) to invoke federal executive intervention via the Immigration Service and ICE.Polanski rightly feared that his due process rights were being stripped, and he fled the country. What would have been a legally simple and straightforward case suddenly became a complete mess. And people who stand up and said his legal rights were being trampled on were infuriatingly correct.Let's hope if he stands trial for another offense, the second court will try him in full process of law so the outcome won't be tainted.And for everybody who argues "he was a scumbag and doesn't deserve constitutional rights", that is exactly how a totalitarian government begins - by identifying demographics that are extremely unlikable and then persuading the public that universal legal rights have attractive exceptions. It helps if the public assumes that they're so different that this deprivation of rights could never happen to them.Not sure about Meryl, but I’m pretty sure Whoopie will say “it wasn’t rape rape.”oh dearoh god oh man oh god oh manDefinitely not her parentsNot her.Time to give him another award and standing ovation I guess.    What a piece of shit.  Then, Meryl Streep can give a speech about the arts, the true arts not silly things like martial arts or football.That was a weird jab to me, I guess the stereotype being they cater to "white hicks" who were pro trump, but mma has a lot of non white and foreign athletes and fanbases in largely non white countries and I can almost guarantee you none of them are trump fans there's also a lot of non whites that watch football as well as most of their players who roll their eyes at the mention of trump, you could make the case because of how some fans reacted to the kneeling but that speech was way before that.I can guarantee you that Meryl Streep knows absolutely nothing about MMA or football and legitimately believes she is higher life form than the people who live in between California and New YorkMemes aside, this actually unironically is why Trump won. They got tired of rich ignorant out of touch elites talking down to them and telling them what to do, so they did the exact opposite without regard for the consequences.She's a good actress though so her opinion matters. /sYou don't actually have to be regal or brave or wise.  You just have to appear to have those qualities.  The appearance is not the reality.  Actors forget this......Sometimes the appearance is the reality, at least when it comes to sex appeal, but not so much the other qualities.  Yeah, it actually does, unfortunately: https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/22/Appeal-to-CelebritySince when are martial arts and football supposed to be considered art. Football is clearly a sport and martial arts is an academic pursuit mixed with sport.Am I missing something?Edit: After much back and forth the answer is no, I'm not. These are sports.Watch the speech please. She takes a super shitty tone about it and basically dismisses sports as a creative pursuit, which if youve ever seen people plan and perform at a high level, it requires tons of creativity.Why diss any profession in the first place? I can live without Meryl Streep and all entertainment. What I cant live without is Stu the garbage man and Joe the plumberWhen it comes down to it - professional athletes ultimately  are just channeling their athleticism from their brain. The same way an artist excels at their craft or generally anyone who excels in their field. I find it fascinating, and it's easy to appreciate it all at high levels. It's amazing that boxing has been around for over a century, and Floyd Mayweather has been in the public eye for decades, but no one ever really figured him out. There is something mysterious and self-expressive about that.Turnabout is fair play. Sports writers can't read Floyd Mayweather.And he. In turn, can't read them. Because he's illiterate.The question is why is sport any less valid a form of self-expression or professional pursuit than acting?  It's not.  Therein lies the smug, elite attitude of Streep.You just don’t get it, do you? If I want to believe football is an art, then it must be an art. Who has the right to tell me otherwise? It’s a well known fact that lexicographers are dirty libruls, who constantly sneer at the rest of us just because they know what words mean and how they should be used.What do you think the 'Art' means in Martial Arts? and you are making fun of others for not knowing what words mean? lolExcept that MMA is an extremely technical and difficult discipline to master. Now of course it's not strictly an art but the vibe I got from her speech was that she was preaching to these "white conservatives" who love MMA instead of acting or painting that it's somehow wrong. Even major athletes in the UFC got pissed at Meryl Streep: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/mma-fighters-meryl-streep-golden-globes-donald-trump-speech-mixed-martial-arts-discrimination-a7521956.htmlMaybe the ironic fact that part of the title of one of the subjects in question is literally "arts" (as in martial).   Well there's also culinary arts, liberal arts, dark arts. I think having arts in the name isn't enough. Then we have dancing, acting, painting, all of which don't have "art" in the name.I think maybe the point there was that arts funding is always being cut and football (in American schools anyway) gets a lot of funding - I could be wrong but that’s the way I understood it. That's how it went at my high school.  They made band and choir non funded extracurricular activities, like an after school club, then they removed all but the most basic art programs from the class offerings, and built a new gym while begging for more more money.  Pathetic.  More than half of Hollywood are struggling waitresses who barely have an education. Many of them never go beyond high school. And we care about what they have to say about politics?its a combination of their status which allows them to spread their views disproportionately to others, and their wealth which allows them to directly influence politics with their wallet. Not to mention reality tv has lead us to a place where otherwise untalented ass clowns becoming some of the most rich and powerful people in the world.Even a high school dropout can make a good point. What we really need is to emphasize critical thinking in our schools, and to be able to intelligently discuss the issues themselves instead of focusing on who is saying them.You and I may not, but they have a massive platform for anything they say. At some point that starts to influence public opinion, regardless of whether you're actively listening to them.I care more what struggling waitresses and waiters think. They are going to be more affected by politics than the wealthy.Barely have an education?  Did they drop out in elementary school?"But he made good movies! "     -Hollywood until last week  Also people in this thread still too. Not even shocking. This guy is a scumbag, I haven't always agreed with the Californian justice system, when it comes to prosecution. But I would back every DA that tried to bag that scumbag. Till this day this man has been defiant about raping a 13 year old girl. When you read what actually happened, the idea of calling it consent is preposterous. I can only imagine the kind of harassment her and her family got to make that woman forgive it. There is a part where she asks to go back, Polanski tells her no. Tried to find the original all i got is this. [This is the man Hollywood chose to defend.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2435255/Samantha-Geimer-Roman-Polanskis-rape-victim-describes-sex-attack-graphic-time.html)That guy is a fucking monster. He isn't misunderstood, I don't care that she came out in 2017 and backed him. That woman was raped, the people around her supported her assailant, and he continued to be called a great man and earn money. If you bought his shit then cry about Weinstein; don't lie to yourself you don't feel that bad.  agree with everything you said and I'd add that a victim forgiving their attacker should be completely irrelevant to the situation. Could be due to harassment, could be due to her coming to terms with what was done to her and rising above it by forgiving the unforgivable. Regardless, it was despicable and dishonest to see people in Hollywood and the media suggest this asshole shouldn't have to answer for his crimes because the victim forgave him. Exactly. Polanski broke the law and should be prosecuted for it. And considering the evidence, he's obviously a threat to children around him, so putting him in jail isn't just right, it's necessary. The US can’t extradite because the French won’t let us. &gt;Polanski broke the law and should be prosecuted for it. He was.  And convicted.  Then he fled to France where they're being fucking rapist enablers and not extraditing him back to the US.My take is - the victim has the right to feel however she feels. No one has the right to tell her how she feels is somehow wrong. Polanski is a dirty child raping scumbag and it's disgusting how he's been defended Holy shit. This is just messed up to hear, but I'm glad its getting more official attention. I remember being irked by an AMA that one of his victims did ~6 months ago where she seemed to have some sort of stockholme sympathy for her rapist. She didnt like the attention he was getting and wanted the past to stay in the past; she kept acting like he was genuinely remorseful about what he had done, and that since he hooked her up financially its not that bad. But in the end, he was just sorry he got caught in the first place. Its sad there is such denial going on in Hollywood and other industries, but seeing more and more stories like these gives me some slight hope. If we shine the light on these rats we can trap them in time. What was also strange was seeing so many redditors jump to Polanski's defense in one way or another. They would argue that you need to separate the man from his work, and to me I just cant see how anyone can really do that when it comes to certain extremes like rape, racism and pedophelia. Unfortunately, even legends like Bill Cosby can be ruined: I just cant enjoy that pudding-pop bit without going to a dark place in my head. And on a more academic level, a lot of Hegel's work makes me raise my eyebrows, even though his brilliance is undeniably essential to modern philosophy as we know it.https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/65gqla/iama_samantha_geimer_the_victim_in_the_1977_roman/A question for Whoopi Goldberg.  You said that when Polanski gave a 13 year old qualudes and then forced anal sex on her, that it was not "rape-rape". What about a 10 year-old Whoopi?&gt; What about a 10 year-old Whoopi?I've become even less trusting of actors today since so many of them covered or remained silent for sexual predators.  &gt;I've become even less trusting of actors today since so many of them covered or remained silent for sexual predators.Yup. We're hearing a lot about those who are willing to speak out *now*, but nothing from those who covered for them for years and years and years and *years*.Wealth silences. Imagine if your neighbor killed a guy and his entire family because he asked him to pull his weeds, and the cops knew he did it, but he was never arrested. Would you ask him to pull his weeds?Rich people destroy lives, you have to be so, so careful if you speak against them. Harvey Weinstein will likely not do anything to his accusers, but you can be sure that other rich people have noticed and will hurt his accusers in the future.Especially in America, where the "justice" system is essentially pay to win.Yup. Americans only have the rights they can afford to vigorously defend in court. The ruling class cares about their own first and foremost. They are all enemies of the rest of us. Correct. The sooner that normal Americans begin to despise the very wealthy and start to work against them, the better off our society will be. Every crushing problem in our society that never gets solved is the fault of the extremely rich, because they profit from suffering rather than solutions.This is not correct.  It's actually a very dangerous idea to spread that if you're wealthy then you're inherently evil.  Many rich people are the horrible people you describe like Weinstein.  But there are many others not on the news that have taken risks, created a ton of jobs, benefited society, and given much of their wealth to charities.  &gt;but you can be sure that other rich people have noticed and will hurt his accusers in the future.Or will just not hire them, not out of spite but out of concern for their own business.  I've seen it happen in a different industry where someone will have difficulties getting hired by people who knew they sued their previous employer.  They're seen as a liability and not worth the effort.You mean you've become less trusting of people who study and practice pretending for a living?Right.  Actors and media figures.  For example Barbara Walters.  This is always so bizarre to me, because the Polanski rape involved sex with a minor, who was drugged, and also said no.It's like the trifecta of rape.  It's the most rape-rape one can imagine.Rape rape? That's still rape. Rape and rape rape is still... rape. Mathematically, rape rape is twice the rape.Mathematically it's rape squared, which is only coincidentally twice the rape for rape=2.I don't think we've rigorously defined our syntax enough to determine what rape rape means. Although I do like that in your rape=2 scenario everyone was right. In programming language, "rape" and "rape rape" are equivalent because both cause errors.  After all, even the computer knows that shit's messed up.I stand corrected.Who cares what she says.A 10 year-old Whoopi won't say anything smarter than a 65 year-old Whoopi.That was one of the worst episodes of Stark Trek.Who cares when Hollywood cover rapists /sThat's the problem in the first place.  Polanski' gotta stop makin' whoopi with 10 year olds.He was never convicted of rape.  He was initially *charged* with rape, but his plea bargain reduced it to "unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor."  In other words, it was only *statutory* rape.Granted, "It wasn't *rape* rape" has to be the *worst* possible way to clarify that fact, but I think it's a shame Goldberg's always brought up as the #1 example of Polanski's defenders in Hollywood for what was essentially just a gaffe.  She never actually defended him or his actions.You know who did though?  [Harvey Weinstein](https://web.archive.org/web/20170712143713/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/harvey-weinstein-polanski-has-served-his-time-and-must-be-freed-1794699.html).  Birds of a feather, I guess.I think you have a skewered version of her comments. She wasn't trying to point out some legal technicality, she was trying to imply that the minor had consented to 'sex' and therefore it wasn't the same as 'stranger rape'.  That's how it was interpreted and she never denied that. If the minor consents, it's *not* the same.  That's literally the difference between forcible rape and statutory rape.She even had someone look up the charges and read them to her in her earpiece so she could repeat them and make sure everyone was using the right language.  That was her job as the moderator of the panel.  Barbara Walters would have done the same thing (though I'm sure she would have found a less sophomoric way to word it).And she did explain herself on the show the next day.  But nobody cared because "*rape* rape" was still a gaffe no matter how she meant it.Many years ago I read the account of what he did to his 13 year old victim. I do not care how good his movies are I will never watch any of them. I am not surprised he did it more than once. If you are willing to rape a child you will do it again. Especially if you get away with it.The accuser's mom sounds like an awful person. Leaving her alone to do the "photo shoot" and according to one of her replies on the tweet &gt;My mom always blamed me &amp; called me a "little Lolita", allowed other men &amp; my dad to sexually use me. Nobody would've believed me if I had.wow. that's sickening.Accused?He was convicted of drugging and raping a minor child and fled the country to avoid incarceration, and nobody in Hollywood cares.  Do we really think another accusation is what's going to finally turn people against him?So is it 'rape-rape' this time? will he get a standing ovation during the Oscars as well? Fucking hypocrites all of them, especially Meryl Streep.What did she say about Polanski? That she was "very sad" that he was arrested. She was also one of the many to sign a petition for his release.My god. Didn't think I'd be able to dislike her but I do now. Those who protect rapists and sexual predators are just as bad as them.She’s overrated anyway.“Sell me your children!”Poor woman, just the thought that Polanski may still have those pictures of her must be so horrifying.I don’t care how Fucking good your movies are if people pull this they should be in Fucking prison and expelled from ever working in Hollywood again. This makes me sick that he would know he did this and all these years try to defend that other accusation. Fucking loser pervert.Whoops Goldberg: "It wasn't *molest* molest.Why was he never extradited?~~Because France won't extradite people to countries that participate in torture. At least, that's what I've been told.~~Apparently he's a French citizen. France won't extradite their own citizens:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition#Own_citizens&gt; By virtue of such jurisdiction, they prosecute and try citizens accused of crimes committed abroad as if the crime had occurred within the country's bordersSo why couldn't they try him in France?The LA DA wouldn't release information to France, because he was already convictedI would imagine that it's impossible to get a fair trial when your victim, witnesses and evidence are on the other side of the ocean.Because he has to be tried where it happened.But the part I quoted specifically says that they don't extradite citizens, but try them in France. Otherwise any French citizen could do whatever they want abroad as long as they successfully escape back to France.except his extradition was denied by the french long before the US legalized "rendition".they didn't extradite him because he was rich and famous and the french extradition policy to the US says that they are allowed to deny extradition of their citizens at their discretion.If polanski had been a plumber he would have been extradited.&gt; If polanski had been a plumber he would have been extradited.When was the last time France extradited a French citizen, let alone a French plumber?Ffs, he's a French citizen and that's why they don't extradite him. Some nations guarantee a 'right of return.' This is done so that their citizens dont get hit with bullshit charges in countries that are enemies of your nation. Powerful pedo friends in France that protected him.That's BS, Polanksi could have been a carpenter and they wouldn't extradite him.There is a giant list of celebrities who signed a petition demanding the release of this man after his arrest in Zurich for drugging a little girl and then fucking her in the ass.

I wasn’t aware of the affair and I acknowledge my ignorance. I was contacted from Cannes Festival. I was told that there was a petition that everyone was signing because what that judge had done to Polanski was against individual rights. I signed it and only after, I read about it, and I now blame myself for it.**Did you repent?**“I trusted him and I was wrong. There were many colleagues involved that had signed, and I hadn’t read well the case. Also, Polanski was one of my favorite directors. I repeat it: trust me, I made a mistake. For this I did: I made a huge mistake. Today I’m even more ashamed of it. Nobody ever forced me, I want to specify. But I trusted people too much. And today, I tell people I wish I had never done it."I'd guess she's an extreme minority on that list though. Anyone that signed this knowing what he did is either a moron that failed to grasp the ultimate gesture of the petition, or complicit in the exact Hollywood culture that enabled this.Sorry, I just formatted the list.  I don't know.Google tells me that yes, she accused him of rape and is currently being ostracized in her native Italy for it. I don't know how to apply that to her defending Polanski.Some commas would be helpful, especially with the French and Spanish names.I don't know who most of those people are.Yes some of them are seemingly obscure. I should look all of them up to put some context to the amount of power these people wield in the world of entertainment. I may edit this post after work. Come on people, you're ruining an entire industry!I refuse to watch his films and other works.I hope there will be more backlash towards him as there is for Weinstein.Hollywood has made it very clear that nobody cares about sexual assault, harassment, and rape of both adults and children, so long as the person makes movies they like.The current Weinstein incident does not represent a changing morality in the Hollywood elite, it's simply a piling on to a current popular news story.  This guy should have been in prison a long time ago. Fuck this scum.We should be worrying about stopping these sexual predators from continuing their long running tradition of assault. Who gives a shit about stupid award shows. Let's go after these fucks for raping, molesting and assaulting thousands of people. This tradition of predatory behavior ends now. Stop fucking caring about them receiving awards. We need to stop them from fucking raping people.The awards matter because when they award people like Polanski andWeinstein, it shows that this is a symptom of a much larger problem within the industry. Clearly it's tolerated on a systematic level within showbusiness.Roman Polanski on first, Bill Cosby on second, Bill O'Rielly on third, Roger Ailes is the 4th at bat AKA clean up hitter, Harvey Weinstien is the short stop....We need four more heavy hitters to fill out this rogues gallery All Star Ball TeamWell, Jared Fogle can be catcher now, rest assured he has all the 5 dollar foot longs he can handle now. Something tells me he's not getting paid 5 bucks apiece for those footlongs.Hm, how many comments are going to be more mad about Meryl Streep than the actual rapist?Honestly, I'm glad there's so many comments calling her out. Streep must either be so divorced from reality, or cares more about her Hollywood friends than a rape victim. And the part that gets me is that she could've just closed her mouth and had that opinion in private. So she obviously feels strongly about it so she deserves some rightful hate.&gt; Streep must either be so divorced from realityThat's what extreme wealth does. Yet we allow the country to be 100% run by the extremely wealthy.Every thread about political parties will eventually come down to idiots talking about how the billionaires that run their party are better than the billionaires who run the other party.Yes okay but there is this guy named Polanski who raped a child, I can't help but think this is the more important facet of the story.Clearly not everyone agrees with me.This just in: People can feel outrage about multiple things at the same timeIs it possible to learn this power?Not from a Jedi.Polanski's deeds have been known for decades, Streeps defense of him is recent. Calling Polanski a creep and a rapist is like calling a shovel a shovel. Streep, by defending the guy, has now put herself in the position of "Fresh kill, tasty tasty!"They're looking at the bigger picture. When Hollywood covers each other in these situations, the overall issue is just gonna get worse. Polanski obviously sucks, we know, but people need to focus on those helping him as well.We know he's a piece of shit.  Most of America thinks hes garbage, but somehow hollywood will lump awards and defend him.And its not just him.Its just another sign at a perpetual culture of silence and "fuck you, I got mine."&gt; Hm, how many comments are going to be more mad about Meryl Streep than the actual rapist?Because pointing out that he is a rapist is not a big deal.  The question at hand is why these people are able to constantly re-offend without suffering consequences.The answer is that there is a culture of elites that protects them.  This needs to be pointed out.I expect a predator to act like a predator. I don't get angry when a snake bites me. I do get angry when a person I expect some empathy from downplays my attack or sympathizes with my attacker more than me.People are mad at 'good people' doing nothing or actively trying to make the situation worse for the victim. People really hate moral hypocrites.Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.Ha, nice reference.Look I got no problem nailing Polanski to the wall. Fuck that rapist. But this happened in 1975 and authorities in France have already shown they’re cool with Polanski being in their country free. So what can we even do here? He should at the very least be a social outcast. Since everything with Weinstein happened a lot of people in Hollywood said they wouldn't turn a blind eye to shit like this anymore. Now's a good time to bring up this shit and make them ostracise him. Maybe stop glorifying a child rapist and giving him Oscars and awards for his work, like Hollywood does.Very little, other than reminding him that we are not going to drop the issue.  I remember him publicly stating that he wished to visit his wife's grave, so I guess all we can do is deny him that and let him die in his self imposed exile.Reminder: [The petition to free Polanski from Swiss custody] has now been signed by more than 70 film industry luminaries, including Polanski's fellow directors Michael Mann, Wim Wenders, Pedro Almodóvar, Darren Aronofsky, Terry Gilliam, Wes Anderson, Julian Schnabel, the Dardenne brothers, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Wong Kar-Wai, Walter Salles and Jonathan Demme. Actors Tilda Swinton, Monica Bellucci and Asia Argento, as well as producer Harvey Weinstein have also put their names on the petition. Yesterday, Weinstein stated he was "calling on every film-maker we can to help fix this terrible situation".Start cross referencing for AMAs.[Full list here](http://www.indiewire.com/2009/09/over-100-in-film-community-sign-polanski-petition-55821/)Yes, these people need to be asked and confronted about that. Else backing such persons will never stop. A lot of those people, especially the directors, seem to want him pardoned because of his artistic ability, which is honestly stupid. interesting that Asia Argento is on that list since she has accused HarveyStop giving money to Hollywood. What can we do?  Not a whole lot.... except to draw a line in the sand and let Polanski know that the first time he steps into a country where we have extradition he is fucked.Also we can stop watching this assholes films.  That too.  Fuck him and fuck his movies.Give him an award in another country, and then nail him there.  It almost worked in Switzerland, but they ruled against extradition due to how poorly the case had been handled in the U.S.What are you referencing?He’s probably referring to the fact the judge openly admitted to pre-judging and pre-sentencing in his country club to the point Polanski’s lawyer heard about his plan to completely ignore the agreed upon plea bargain and sentence him to 50+ years. Also, a DA claimed on camera in a documentary that he coached the judge.To be fair, plea bargains are between the prosecution and defence. Judge's aren't obligated to agree to them. That said, in a legal context the judge's statements are troubling.Plea bargains like this are against the spirit of law in many countries, which is why judges there see it as a factor against extradition.&gt; But this happened in 1975 and authorities in France have already shown they’re cool with Polanski being in their country free.They just will never extradite one of their own citizens.Stop watching his movies.in his defense, she looked 13...Who would have thought the guy who drugged and anally raped a 13 year old was a pedoThis also just in - Those with power and influence do whatever they want while other people that want power and influence let themyeah . . . I'd say he's done this beforeWhy is it this guy can walk the streets freely and nobody had just socked this guy in the face atleast once? Because it's only acceptable to punch people spouting stuff you disagree with. What? A pedophile committing pedophilia? No. GaspI wish Hollywood cared about rape victims half as much as they care about someone saying crude things on Twitter I suspect the pedo problem is much much worse than we inititally think, especially among the hollywood elite that use their power to hide it. [removed]Also, record producer terry melcher used to live in that house, its rumored Manson may have thought melcher still lived there and wanted revenge for his failed music careerThat's not a rumor, he told one of his followers to go to the record producer's house and kill everyone there.Lol, and hollywood still thinks we should take them seriously when they lecture us from an awards show pulpit.  Get your own house in order before you judge mine.Lots of kid fucking in Hollywood.  Keep that in mind when you go to the movies. I'm sorry but isn't this the guy that can't come to the US because he's a child predator? Hollywood going to come to his defense yet again?I'm not surprised by this but I am surprised that people like Barbara Walters and Meryl Streep aren't being called out on turning a blind eye on these monsters.Meryl Streep and the rest of hollywood still love him.Always so strange to me, people like this, Woody Allen who married his adopted kid at 17.  People love them, give them awards, have award ceremonies for them.  It is unreal.  Maybe Allen didn't break the law and skate justice like a common scumbag criminal as Polanski is but the idea that he's some great guy we now hold up in esteem.  People that do that are scum.  Meryl Streep?  What a disgrace of a human being she is.  Hey maybe the 13 year old he "slept with" who did an AMA could comment on this because she swears it was consensual .... can a 13 year old have consensual sex... horrible I don't think she said it was consensual, per se – which is why her attitude towards Polanski today -- i.e., I forgive him, he's not a bad guy -- struck me as so odd. A couple of commenters in that AMA theorized that her glowing comments were somehow related to the cash settlement he gave her. They were downvoted to heck, as I recall, but I honestly think they may have been on to something.  Was this the same girl from the infamous case? Because if so it wasn't consensual and she has never said it was.Perverts gonna perv. Why is anyone surprised by this? Hollywood lifts him up as if he’s some sort of oppressed victim of the system.  He raped a child and was convicted.Again?  How many lives does this guy have?If only rich people would settle for fine wine and cheese like they used to. Powerful people have never settled for anything.Wait, that's not the Roman Polanski I know...So, who, in Hollywood, wants to argue for dropping rape charges and letting him back into the United States, NOW?! Sit down, Harvey. You don't count.The movie producer's plot in the original Godfather novel was very similar to this, where the mother essentially handed the daughter off to be raped. Pretty sure this was not a coincidence.Roman Polanski is a Hollywood worshiped pedophile and has been for decades.  I don't care how great of a director he is, the man is a fugitive from justice.  Did I wake up in the 1970's? Because that's when this news is from.I wish we'd had some indication he might do something like this! Oh, wait. That's right. He's done the same thing before.remember how all these Hollywood types were defending this man for decades?Hopefully the family does something to protect their child because governments are unable to bring this guy to heel.This happened in 1975, the 10 year old he molested is a middle aged adult now. Not fully related, but I thought Hollywood was about 10 years ahead of everyone else when it comes to social justice, lol .......as my mind  wanders back to the George Clooney smug speech.
They’re not going to fix all those cars that have been sitting for a year.  They will probably end up scrapping most of them.
Is this judge a rational person?

Stop going to North Korea.Using that logic, we would still be killing each other. We have a ceasefire with North Korea, and that was only possible by going there and negotiating with them. This idea that we are not allowed to ever declare peace or sign treaties against our enemies is insane. We would never stop fighting. You ever seen the room that connects the two countries? Soldiers making contact to to other side hold on to someone to prevent being pulled into north korea. Jimmy will never go there the risk is to damn high allowing a former president over enemy lines. Hurting Jimmy Carter is a sure fire way to get yourself fucking killed.Russia and China won't be able to sweep that under the rug.If anything North Korea wouldn't *want* Carter there. Dude is 93 years old. What if he passed away peacefully from natural causes while there?That'd look *super* bad.&gt;That'd look super bad.I don't know, this is Trump we're talking about.  He'll use a 'super bad' scandal to cause chaos so he can get something else done, or just for added protection.  We may very well do nothing simply because it is scandalous.If you have carter thats a huge bargaining chip obviously. And we couldn't do anything without them killing him. No no.Kidnapping Carter, a former President, and Nobel Peace Prize winner, who's offering to come as an ambassador and advocate against war, is suicide. You've just *lost* all your bargaining chips.Right now NK is more or less maintaining the same level of rhetoric that our inflammatory shithead Commander in Chief is advocating.Right. This is a popular Trump bargaining tactic often referred to (sometimes literally) as "shooting the hostage."&gt; Right. This is a popular Trump bargaining tacticWait, really?Surrendering all of your leverage is one of his bargaining tactics?Jesus.&gt; Kidnapping Carter, a former President, and Nobel Peace Prize winner, who's offering to come as an ambassador and advocate against war, is suicide.&gt;You've just lost all your bargaining chips.Well, diplomatic relations would cease to exist, but I doubt it would lead to a war in itself.Considering that NK used its military so for "enchanced begging", it would be certainly unlikely.We aren't bargaining, so what use are chips?Diplomacy *is* bargaining.Precisely. We (any involved nation) aren't being very diplomatic. Just a lot of saber rattling and outright threats. Send the diplomat and appease the fires of nuclear war - a war where everyone loses.I'm speaking to these comments in the thread:&gt; Jimmy will never go there the risk is to damn high allowing a former president over enemy lines.And:&gt;If you have carter thats a huge bargaining chip obviously. And we couldn't do anything without them killing him.And my response is that's about the worst move you could possibly make even if NK strategy is to have a leg up or leverage in diplomacy, because that's an act of war, and burns any and every bridge they have.Yea, I’ve been in that room. South Korean guards at the DMZ all wear aviator ray bans and stand in a ridiculous tar Kwon do stance.Oh shit, Ray Bans?Yep, for free. Almost makes the nuclear stand off worth-it.Jesus. Thats fucking scary that has to happenYou severely underestimate him. Jimmy Carter fears no man.Well yeah, he's 93!Didn’t we send Bill Clinton there a few years ago to get some hostages back?Carter gets secret service protection, so he'd be fine. Anyone that doesn't shouldn't go. Like 10 agents would make any difference when your in the middle of Pyongyang.  If they want to take him and hold him somewhere the usa is in a bind when a former president is somewhere hidden on the nuclear target. Takes whole options off the table then our "attack" would become rescue mission. Yes its suicide for NK but they just tilted the war in there favor slightly. &gt; Using that logic, we would still be killing each other. We have a ceasefire with North Korea, and that was only possible by going there and negotiating with them.**Oh damn, if only we had an audio/microphone device that would allow long distance communication between two or more parties...****Edit: There is no need to get salty and downvote me just because you forgot telephones exist.**You made your point like a salty little bitch,  then accused other people of being salty. LolUmm no you obviously misread my comment, I never accused "people" I said "you" (singular not plural) because I was talking about King_of_the_pups. within 1 minute of my comment he downvoted me without comment, that is why I made the edit. Don't jump to conclusions, especially when you don't read the comment thoroughly.Why is everyone so mean now? Just calm down pleaseExcept that North Korea has repeatedly shown they have no respect for anyone, even their own citizens. When Carter gets detained and thrown into a prison camp like countless others, will you then say "send someone else for a peace talk to retrieve him."?  These talks don't work with certain countries and people, that includes NK.North Korea would have lost their minds to detain a former president. It would be akin to declaring war and would be treated as such. So if there is any good to come of this, I welcome it. While being highly skeptical of its effectiveness. As opposed to their otherwise rational behavior this year /sWhat they've done all this year is inflammatory but more chest thumping than anything.   Arresting a former President would be an extremely aggressive act akin to actually throwing a nuke at someone. What's the sarcasm tag for? You really think NK has acted irrationally this year? Can't expect people to understand global affairs other than what has been rendered down to a meme.People who believe that the North Korean regime are irrational actors are at odds with top CIA officials: https://guardian.ng/news/north-koreas-kim-very-rational-says-cia/Yeah, rationality is totally why Kim killed his own brother earlier this year. /sActually it was, yes. His brother was reportedly poised to overtake Kim in a coup, killing his brother prevented that. It was absolutely a rational move. Lol his brother was hardly a threat to the heavily isolated dictatorship of North Korea, especially coming from little Malaysia.  If the rumors were correct, China would be responsible.  The rational thing to have done was to denounce China in front of the world and cut off ties rather than act out of paranoia and kill a person who did you no harm while also publicly expressing no interest in politics.In what would it be a rational action to cut off ties with China? How would that improve North Koreas situation?lets put it this way... why create the situation in the first placeNormally I would agree with you, but nobody did anything when they sunk the navy vessel or shelled an island in both cases resulting in casualties.Those both belonged to South Korea. It was up to South Korea to determine if that meant war. However, I’d wager NK would have a different reaction from the US if they sunk a US destroyer. And especially if they kidnapped a former president. What nonsense. Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter himself have been there before. NK isn't stupid enough to lay a finger on someone as high profile as a former US president. It then becomes a matter of pride to USA and they will bomb the shit out of NK.Jimmy is a dem. Some say the most liberal dem ever. Trump would allow it. Well it will be a slap on the face of any president if a former president is kidnapped by a foreign power under his watch. Doesn't matter if he's a lib or a hardcore conservative.FYI Carter was far from most liberal. If N. Korea throws a former president into a prison camp, they're gonna get the shit bombed out of them.  Especially if it's a popular one like Carter.  I'm sure they care.There is absolutely zero chance of that happening. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about at all and should be ashamed of yourself. Totally. They definitely didn't detain and kill someone who "stole a poster". They also haven't kidnapped movie directors from other countries to make NK based movies.Definitely ashamed.Are you seriously comparing a college kid and a movie director with a President of the United States?Just stop.I'm saying they don't stop at anything to do what they want. Do you really think North Korea cares that the country they hate the most has a former president coming over? Probably not. If they are going out of their way to kidnap people I doubt they care what someone's title is.You can't say that because they would imprison a kid or kidnap a director, that they would do the same to a President.There are different implications involved. You might get in an argument with a coworker/teacher, and call him an idiot, but would you do the same to your boss/principal? People behave differently in situations where the consequences are also different. NK knows that they can get away with imprisoning a kid, they also know that they couldn't get away with imprisoning a U.S. President. The consequences would be swift, severe, and dangerously impact their relations with nearly every nation in the world.That is one helluva leap in logic there. College kid ≠^40 Former President of the USYes, because NK cares about titles of Americans.Jimmy Carter says yes!It's not like he's going for tourism, dude. Calm down.The real question is will NK keep Carter and how do we encourage it?They DON'T WANT PEACE. He wants to keep his personal utopia for as long as possible while avoiding a downfall similar to when the soviet union opened the iron curtain and their own people could suddenly see how much better life had become on the outside.I thought Dennis Rodman was the ambassador to North Korea? Jimmy Carters 93 he could die any Day i don't think him dying of natural causes while in NK would go so well for diplomatic relations.Hope this plays out like that episode of King of the Hill**Trump**: So are you Chinese or Japanese?     **Kim**: We North Korean. A mountainous region of Korean peninsula between East and Yellow Seas.    **Trump**: &lt;blinks&gt; So...are you Chinese or Japanese?He ain't chinese...he's Laotian (said in accusatory tone) The ocean? Which ocean?Khan! *clap clap* My bags!*Ain'tcha Mister Khan?* From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter):&gt; In 1994, North Korea had expelled investigators from the International Atomic Energy Agency and was threatening to begin processing spent nuclear fuel. In response, then-President Clinton pressured for US sanctions and ordered large amounts of troops and vehicles into the area to brace for war.[citation needed]&gt; Bill Clinton secretly recruited Carter to undertake a peace mission to North Korea,[143] under the guise that it was a private mission of Carter's. Clinton saw Carter as a way to let North Korean President Kim Il-sung back down without losing face.[144]&gt; Carter negotiated an understanding with Kim Il-sung, but went further and outlined a treaty, which he announced on CNN without the permission of the Clinton White House as a way to force the US into action.He fucked up once already! We owe the current crisis to Carter's "diplomatic success", to a large extent. And does he really think Trump is really THAT stupid? I mean, come on, after what Carter did to Clinton, you have to be a fucking imbecile to let him anywhere near North Korea again...This time we send Carter strapped with a suicide vestGreat now we're all on a listHi NASA!zero gravity beheadings brought to you by ISSThe Islamic Space State? I thought ***Captain*** Zapp Brannigan took care of them ages ago!&gt;He fucked up once already! We owe the current crisis to Carter's "diplomatic success"Here I thought we owed it to a 50 policy that doesn't involve a peace treaty from the Korean War and a regime that requires fear of the "other" and brutal conditions to solidify its power.Really if you want to stop north Korean aggression and not deal at all with the humanitarian needs of their population, you draw up a peace agreement that guarantees the sovereignty of the NK state and regime, that's their go to demand and has been since the "end of the war"You can probably understand why we don't give into that demand. I didn't say he's the only one to blame. Certainly, the Korea issue is more complex than that. I was talking strictly about the issue of NK having nuclear weapons. Carter's (and Clinton's) plan of appeasement has failed spectacularly, and it's much harder and more dangerous to deal with them now.&gt; Really if you want to stop north Korean aggression and not deal at all with the humanitarian needs of their population, you draw up a peace agreement that guarantees the sovereignty of the NK state and regimeThat's a pipe dream. NK regime is **not** sustainable. No matter what we sign or not sign, their regime will fail sooner or later, and we'll have to deal with the humanitarian crisis then. &gt;That's a pipe dream. NK regime is not sustainable. No matter what we sign or not sign, their regime will fail sooner or later, and we'll have to deal with the humanitarian crisis then.I said aggression. I’m sure that while he’s there he’d certify NK elections as free of problems, fair and transparent while simultaneously calling on the UN to send monitors to the US to oversee the electoral process.  Your hatred of your fellow Americans is unhealthy. Carter is not only not a bad person, he is actually world renowned for being one of the most caring and selfless leaders in US history. If you cant get along with someone like that, who CAN you get along with? &gt; caring and selflessI’d have settled for ‘competent’.I won’t fault the man’s charity work, and he seems a very decent fellow... off the clock. But to paraphrase one Gregory House: “do you want a doctor who holds your hand while you’re dying, or one that ignores you while you get better?”And again: his glowing praise of Venezuela’s Chavista voting regimen while *similtaneously* calling US elections too problematic to escape UN interference is... amusing.He also forced Egypt and Israel to sign a peace deal that is still in effect. At the time, Egypt was just as hostile to Israel as Iran. He's not perfect, but he *can* get some serious shit done.Someone can be selfless, kind, good, all those things, and still be a bad president/ diplomat. Likewise, you can be an asshole and be a good president. I voted for Carter. I later regretted it. His brother would make a better diplomat. Billy’s dead but he’d still be better!I think Carter is a great guy, but I still don't think he's the right person to negotiate with North KoreaAt 93, maybe not. I'd definitely be worried about his health and safety.They wouldn't touch him, but it still wouldn't be a very bright idea.Would he have to take a secret service detail with him? How does that work with the travel ban?What travel ban are you referring to?This one. https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/world/asia/north-korea-american-tourists.html?_r=0&amp;referer=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/08/31/world/asia/us-north-korea-travel-ban.htmlThanks. I just read up on it a bit, and it looks like the State Department can issue exceptions for when someone is going for journalism or humanitarian reasons. I'm assuming Carter and his fellow travelers would have to get permission.That makes sense, of course the state dept would give an exception for Carter and his detail. Thanks. It's the last place where he hasn't shaken any hands. He got the rest of us.Will need to wear nose rings, ear studs, and color his hair like a slushie.....Fuckboi carter at it againBAMF old-ass President stares down Kim Jong Un. "I survived stage-3 melanoma, bitch. What are you gonna do, shoot me with artillery? That would just give me back to the earth and make stronger."He's got to be better than cheeto von dipshit.Better in what regards? Carter is a better human being, but he was a mediocre President.Mediocre is better than shitty. Although I guess we've got plenty of time to see if trump manages to do something with the presidency. Maybe it'll be better than mediocre but I'm not holding my breath.Better than the asshole we have now?  Better in every regard.Last good president we had. The rot set in with Reagan and has culminated with Trump.What the hell for? Does he honestly think Trump can shut his mouth long enough for him to say anything that might calm the situation?  If so, he hasn't been paying attention.Who the fuck cares? Like they give a shit about what some ancient ex-president says about anything.Diplomacy instead of nuclear pissing contest? Yeah, who the fuck cares?Unfortunately this is what the Trump administration actually believes.Why would Mr. Kim give a flying fuck about what Jimmy Carter has to say? And why would anyone else, for that matter?He gives a fuck what Dennis Rodman has to say, so why wouldn't he give a fuck what Jimmy Carter has to say?I say we send trump first. Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Mango Man has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over.so you're suggesting Trump may bite off Kim Jong-Un's "button finger", saving us all ?I’m not eager to deal out death, I’m eager to see if trump is willing to talk shit to ‘ rocket-mans ‘ face instead of using his twitter account. Trade, and not Trump’s rhetoric and not sanctions will open North Korea to it the rest of the world. I'm as much a believer in the power of capitalism as anyone but all money would go straight to the regime.Isn't that what we want, tho?  For them to be like the U.S.?What you appear to be advocating for either a continuation of the current failed policies, or what? Invading or bombing the country and annihilating the North Korean populace? Just like Iraq, Afghanistan?To open borders it takes trade and/or exchange of knowledge. Military options never work. And you are the world's foremost authority on North Korea and world trade?Fine. He can't come back any more brain damaged than he already is, so he's got an advantage over the last guy. The only thing we should be sending them are massive amounts of TNT. Its the only thing theyll pay attention to. And take some of Trump's spotlight?  Not going to happen.Good, hopefully they keep him.

This is Japan. Most of the population has one foot in the grave already. The moderate gusts of wind and rain we had yesterday was sure to blow at least a couple of these geezers all the way in.In most cases, "typhoon" is Japanese for "rain storm."Not much respect for your elders I take it?I agree with you. Over 70% of the country still has very old wood houses. Not everyone lives in a concrete hut. Also have seen a large gale break a chain on a sign and it went flying down the street till it hit a building. 
I'm no expert but if my neighborhood was next to that neighborhood I would look to pool resources and deploy dozens of cameras. Now that the heat is on he will probably look for new places.

common knowledge that officers can use deadly force if they see you using a deadly weapon.(in prison)Often a deadly weapon is being used but the officers can't see it so they can't shoot.They saw it this time.&gt;Correctional officers tried to break up the fight using less-than-lethal force, first by firing 40-millimeter impact rounds, similar to rubber bullets, into the crowd, Khokhobashvili said. When that didn’t work, they launched pepper-spray grenades into the scrum and fired a warning shot...That’s when officers opened fire.    From the initial report it seems like they tried to stop the "shanking" in a non lethal way with incremental use of force.Damn, I would not want to get hit with a 40 mike-mike rubber bullet."2,100 inmates and about 1,700 employees." I'm hoping that includes prisoners who work in the prison. I doubt it,  prisons are horribly understaffed. Most run at less than 60% staffing. I had a 102 to 1 ratio when I was s correctional officer. &gt;"2,100 inmates and about 1,700 employees." I'm hoping that includes prisoners who work in the prison. That's insane.  It's a specialized prison with lots of physicians and mental health staff.These guys are just mixing/mashing Johnny Cash songs
Not the first time he's been alleged to do this.  I used to post there back in the day, and he posted a story about groping women while he was on a European trip.  He later deleted it all and banned anyone who talked about it.I never posted there as they didn't accept gmail....It’s for the best - you would have been banned for something stupid anywayYou missed nothing.  Trust me.WTH is NeoGAF?Large gaming forum that for years was a hot spot for insider information to the industry. Then over the years there were a number of incidents with the admins of the site that no one was allowed to discuss without a permanent ban. Eventually than ban happy nature expanded to removing anyone suspected of having the 'wrong opinion' on just about anything. It shutting down due to this isn't surprising, what's surprising is how long it took. It's a big time site for gaming and known to only accept certain emails to join. Makes it exclusive.An old ass gaming forum. It's not even owned by any media network, just a plain regular Internet forum run by unpaid enthusiasts, seriously no idea why this is on the news. Do they need to give us "Reddit News" too now when some stupid drama unfolds? Supposedly the owner was offered 5 million dollars for the forum a few years back. Maybe the deal is still on the table.I was reading it was 10 million.  I doubt it at this point.I heard that he said something about the offer doubling at some point, but I'm a bit skeptical.He should have taken that deal in my opinion.  He will be lucky to get $100,000 for it now.  He will be lucky getting $5.000 now.I would buy it from him for $5.  But  I will not pay a cent more.We have no idea what kind of revenue the site was generating, if the site were generating middle six figures of revenue it would be worth it to hang onto it for as long as possible./pol/ loves this stuff so it ends up here through it's surrogates.The implosion of people who claim to have a moral high ground is always deeply entertaining.What? But this dude used to brag about all the women he'd grope when he was on vacation in Europe. There never was moral high ground. Hell his one moderator was arrested for pedophilia. He went full white knight a while back, and would ban whoever mentioned his groping spreeHe didn't just ban, he deleted people.  Someone made a joke about him and he made the account a guest.  That wipes out the account like it never existed.  Dude was super thin skinned.  Then add in the recent former mod that got busted for being a pedo that he pretended he never knew.  He knew the guy, he's the one who made him a mod!  Neogaf needed to go.He started a GoFundMe to help his sick mom. He used some of the money for his own little drug stash.He was arrested after hitting his mom like a punching bag because he couldn't watch a TV show he was halfway through.Oh yes, I know the whole twisted tale.  So him acting like he didn't even know his name was a bunch of bullshit.The sub was notorious for banning people who didn't agree with whatever the cause du jour was.Typically things like not condemning some game developer or company that, e.g. Portrayed women in a way the forum didn't like would result in a ban.Specific examples would be saying you thought Quiet or Cindy was fine.The guy running the place had a holier-than-thou attitude and was a real internet thug. I'm glad to see that he reaped what he sowed.I hesitate to say this because I wasn't there but taking this woman's words literally, no physical contact occurred.  They were friends, close enough that they are sharing a hotel room and getting intoxicated together, and he drunkenly gets into the shower with her. She tells him he's making a big mistake, he gets out immediately, and then sulks the remaining time they're together.  This seems extreme that she would charge her friend with a sex crime when he didn't touch her or make advances before they got drunk.  I would call this this a terrible misunderstanding.  Thoughts ?&gt;  I would call this this a terrible misunderstanding. Thoughts ?I tend to agree, BUT, if this "terrible misunderstanding" had happened to anyone else, this fucker would be the first witchhunter in line with a torch and pitchfork, while screaming for blood.Also, he would have banned anyone who posted what you just posted, so now, there ain't nobody left on his site who isn't a rabid "burn first, determine facts second" type.So he's fucked. Entirely of his own doing.She was so drunk she was vomiting, and she had a boyfriend and hadn't expressed any interest in this guy. Getting into a shower with a drunk, sick, naked, vulnerable woman without her consent crosses some *very* obvious boundaries.Yeah, but the fact of the matter is, it's *not* sexual assault, or even rape. It's not even a sex crime.He attempted something, that's pretty fucking terrible don't get me wrong, but he actually never assaulted her.But he did post revenge porn in 2006.https://imgur.com/uRGmEGLAnd he did admit to grabbing ass while clubbing in Europe in 2012. Talking how he wanted her to know he wasn't to be taken advantage of or some shit.He deserves everything that's happening right now. Get a taste of the medicine his forum was serving for a number of years.You should at least agree that there is irony here: this guy posted revenge porn and admitted to a serious sexual harassment of a woman, but what ultimately destroys him is an incident where he acted in a scummy but legal way and ultimately took no for an answer.Edit: a more fitting word.Edit 2: reading things again, he approached her naked in the shower. The act of entering the shower room was likely a crime. This is less ironic than i thought.He may have done that THEN, but we're talking about right NOW. In this specific case, he did not assault her.Actually, it totally is. Check it:  https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault&gt;Sexual assault is any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient. Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape.Key things: "any type of sexual contact OR BEHAVIOR" and "attempted rape."That's really stretching the definition of "sexual contact or behavior". I doubt that a court of law would see getting into a shower with someone as inherently sexual behavior.For a person with an apparent history of sexual assaults? You'd be surprised. I mean, I wouldn't be though.Also, when's the last time two unmarried folks of opposite sexes got in to the shower, both of them naked, and they just washed each other completely devoid of any sexual influences whatsoever?She was in a position where she might not have been able to stop him, and her vulnerability is exactly why he tried that. It was an attempted rape, and I'm glad she was able to prevent it.She said no and he got out no attempting if rape involvedHe made a pass while traveling to a city with a woman? I mean it was hard pass but those are exactly the type of circumstances that's expected. Especially after a night of drinking.Having different expectations of a relationship ain't sexual assault.His actions out of context seem bad, but after a night of drinking while out visiting a city that seems typical. He made a mistake and didn't want to be her friend. Ok....He could have maybe asked, you know, for consent.  Just jumping into a shower with a girl you know is seeing somebody and went to the bathroom to throw-up isn't exactly acceptable behavior.  He didn't force himself on her, but he definitely crossed some lines and that should not be ignore--especially considering his history.Being drunk must have made him think it was okay as she did agree to share the same room after they spent the day together.He did back off when she said no.Well the story claims they were on a road trip together and had an established history of being friends.He could've, he messed up but women get turned on by a guy who acts, too. It's a little unfair to expect that if men and to vilify them for it.&gt; but women get turned on by a guy who acts, too.We do? I guess I didn't get the memo. Probably best to clarify that some *people* get turned on by actions, at times. Men and women; it goes both ways. People aren't monoliths. Some women get turned on by men of action, just as some men get turned on by women who take make the first move in what is commonly labeled as "role reversal."You personally may not get "turned on" by the idea of a man taking you by the waist, catching your eyes with his gaze, and pressing his lips to meet yours in a sudden rush of unexpected passion, but some women are. I personally have been in a relationship that went from friend-zone to exclusive dating/living together/marriage/kids primarily based on what I just described. The woman who would bear my children and take my name was turned on by me taking action. It has been like this since time immeasurable. The whole romance novel genre is based on stories like this.&gt; The woman who would bear my children and take my nameThis wording makes me feel weird. Who talks like this.I've been drunk with friends before and shared rooms with people (cheaper rate, hurray!) but never have I or any of my friends thought it would be appropriate to join them in a shower after they got so sick from drinking they vomited. Who makes a pass on someone while they're ill??&gt;Sexual assault is any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient. Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape.https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault&gt;or behaviorIf it were my partner I would have to explain why I was in a hotel room drinking alone w/ the opposite sex.  I'm sure there is more to the story.Yup, can't trust women to associate with men at all. You know, why stop at drinking, what about eating? I mean, we should really be requiring women to be wearing burkas if we're being honest. If it were my partner, showing her exposed face, I'd obviously be sure there'd be more to the story.Lol, yea cause women would totally not care if they're bf was drinking and sharing a room with a female friend in another city.There wouldn't be any suggestions of anything going on. Like totally wouldnt. It wouldn't become a fight or anything. Also can we cut the islamaphobia! The burka is a religious garb. It isn't to be used for your insults.You're taking his comment substantially out of context. Nothing justifies breaching consent, but getting heavily intoxicated and sharing a hotel room with someone while you are in a relationship is certainly...unusual behavior. Again, nothing justifies a lack of consent, but in trying to understand what occurred, the social implications of having drinks while sharing a hotel room does need to be considered. That's not victim blaming, it's just basic investigation.Well, when she said no he didn't push it did he?&gt;You're taking his comment substantially out of context. Nothing justifies breaching consent, but getting heavily intoxicated and sharing a hotel room with someone while you are in a relationship is certainly...unusual behavior.You're missing the point that I was making. Getting drunk and sharing a hotel room with friends should not be an indication for concern. The person I was responding to was saying that if she's doing these two perfect legal, perfectly ethical, perfectly platonic things, there **must** be something sexual going on.&gt;Again, nothing justifies a lack of consent, but in trying to understand what occurred, the social implications of having drinks while sharing a hotel room does need to be considered. That's not victim blaming, it's just basic investigation.If your first question is "why were you doing this inherently unsexual things that we are going to define as sexual", then my analogy is perfect. This is the exact same argument people use against women wearing full burkas. *What was she doing in public without being totally covered?* *it seems unusual that she'd show so much skin and not be interested.*I understand what you're trying to say, that she put herself in a bad situation and that it's worth exploring, but what I'm saying is that this isn't inherently a bad situation, that looking at it under this lens makes people no better than people who relate modesty with sex crimes.I think asserting "getting drunk together in a hotel room is an inherently unsexual/platonic thing" is pushing a very narrow interpretation of such behavior. You are correct that it is entirely possible that it was intended by one or both parties as platonic, but it's also a very common precursor to romantic or sexual behavior.  It is just ambiguous enough that exploring the relationship between the two individuals further is necessary before being able to make a determination of what occurred.She went to another city with him, got drunk with him and is sharing the same room as him.As they were both drunk he got the wrong idea.Yes, I am aware. What's your point?She made many mistakes, he isn't totally wrong fir assuming she wanted more and them being drunk made them think unclearly.If You are eating any food that acts the same as alcohol, let me know your dealer.You know it's weird. If alcohol just turned women into massive sluts, why was she able to refuse him in the shower?It's almost as if it's possible to get drunk with someone of the opposite sex and not want to fuck them. Kind of like how women can show their faces to men and also not want to fuck them.I know, it's a pretty radical idea.That's why Mike Pence refuses to be alone with women.  Can't make it through a single meal without one of those ravenous lust monsters trying to jump his divine bones.Mike Pence is a sexist homiphobe who has nothing to do with this.[Mike Pence won't dine alone with other women--regardless of setting--to prevent infidelity.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/03/30/mike-pence-doesnt-dine-alone-with-other-women-and-were-all-shocked/?utm_term=.dde212f76221)&gt;During his 12 years in Congress, Pence had rules to avoid any infidelity temptations, or even rumors of impropriety. Those included requiring that any aide who had to work late to assist him be male, never dining alone with a woman other than his wife, and not attending an event where alcohol is served unless Karen was there.&gt;In a 2002 interview with The Hill, Pence called it, “building a zone around your marriage.”&gt;“If there's alcohol being served and people are being loose, I want to have the best-looking brunette in the room standing next to me,” Pence said.I wonder if any of these people realize that they basically hold similar views to Mike fucking Pence.I wonder if it makes them want to reconsider.Ok but she was comfortable enough to be alone in a hotel room drinking with him. They were friends.  (Edit: Misread you, sorry) Which doesn't green light him getting in a shower with her. Why is everything a woman does considered consent? A smile isn't consent. A wink isn't consent. Drinking isn't consent. Consent is consent. Because for the longest time certain body language was counted as consent with the expectation to say no if it went further than either party was comfortable with.  Even now that same standard is applied to male consent as society tolerates a woman taking strong initiative with a man and expecting the man to say no if the woman goes too far.

A quick turnaround from the WHO, but this incident is another reminder of the cronyism and back scratching that is endemic in the halls of these powerful institutions. The sheer arrogance to believe that appointing such a man would not raise any objection is incredible.All it took was the entire world collectively facepalming.The UN "peacekeeper" rape and sex trafficking scandals alone put the Catholic Church to shame.The difference is that the church is actually ashamed. The UN never would be. There's also the fact that for all its faults, the Catholic Church has helped a lot of people over the years.Hey , though, if it weren't for the UN, the people of Haiti would still be living without cholera. They rape, but they save!It has hurt far more than helped.  Just like any religion they put on a good looking benevolent face and then tell you not to question their authority.  Sounds like a kind of dictatorship.  Plus the whole suppressing of science thing that still happens..Yes as an institution the Catholic Church has managed to systematically hinder scientific progress while ruining the lives of school children and hiding the abuse. They also spread their ideas like a plague throughout the world so that abuse can continue.Yes there’s a couple nice programs run by people who would have done similiar things without the help of the Catholic Church. As a whole though the Catholic Church has been the bane of western civilization.You seem to have passed legitimate criticism into some good old evangelical protestant inspired papal panic.Man i went to catholic school. that shit is bunk and there is no saving it.Where I live we just call them schools.That sounds terrible.The Catholic Church has probably advanced science more than any other religion.It's not much, but it's definitely... Not the worst.i wasn't comparing it to other religions just examining it on its on merits.For most of its existence, everyone on Earth was religious. You really can't analyse this in a vacuum.Wow. Absolutely not. Thinking that shows an absolute lack of knowledge of the history of what we call Western civilization. which is apparently a subject you are ignorant of.proof in [le ultimate euphoric graph form](http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/darkages.gif) (now with 200% more FACTS and SCIENCE)This graph makes sense to me. I didn't put any focus on to religion and nuked Germany in 1010 AD in my last game of civilization.Proven through advanced computer simulation.  And it wasn't some book of fairytales that gave us the computer!  Checkmate fundies!Sure thing bud. Laugh it up. The reality is the Catholic Church has done significantly more harm than good over the course of its history and to claim otherwise is ignorant.Not really, the Catholic church has done a lot of good. Especially in the fields of philosophy and law. It seems pretty ironic that you, in such a dogmatic way, disregard people with a different opinion as ignorant. I'm not judging your opinion or even your right to believe in a religion. Any good the catholic church has brought into this world pales in comparison too the harm, violence, and abuse it has wrought.Again, not necessarily true. In the wake of the fall of the western Roman empire, the Catholic church worked as one of the only stable pillars of a common European civilization. Canonic law was in fact used all over Europe, creating a kind of proto-EU. For hundreds of years the church was the only institution where people of common birth could get educated.It wasn't really until the founding of the university of Bologna that this changed. Ironically, what was mainly taught at Bologna was Canonic and Roman law. What I'm saying is that it's not black or white. The church, like any other organisation that's too big to fail has had, and certainly has issues, but without it there would be no Europe and hence no USA.lol, the Catholic Church is the main culprit in the HIV epedemic that has ravaged africa. it is a force of evil in this world.except that the church helped sex offending priests escape prosecution on numerous occasions  The UN doesn't provide those Peacekeepers, they are on loan from member nations and typically from ones in the region. So in Africa most of the UN Peacekeepers tend to be from a neighboring nation with it's own problems, so they send their worst units to join the UN Peacekeeper force. So it tends to be a shit show most of the time in areas of the world already affected by elevated corruption rates. The actual UN officials only tend to be upper management of these operations, unless a 1st world countries like USA takes an active interest.They really wanted Kim jun unApparently he's busy helping them with nuclear non-proliferationThey'll appoint him when they're done with the Council on Women's Rights consisting of Iran, Sudan and SomaliaNo who they really wanted was the lead scientist of Unit 731. Good, but the damage to WHO’s credibility has been done. Thankfully it will likely be forgotten in a few weeks. They just need to not shot themselves in the foot again. Honestly why was he even appointed in the first place. He's 93 and can't keep awake for more that 15 minutes at a timeLets not forget the human rights violations hes caused. Why do you think something like this should be forgotten?  This is cronyism at the highest level of international institutions It's not that it *should* be forgotten, but that it *will* be forgotten.Pretty sure they were being sarcastic lolNo, I’m actually serious. It’s about the good that WHO can do outweighing the bad. &gt;This is cronyism at the highest level of international institutions What connection does Tedros Adhanom have to Zimbabwe?All Africans are the same right? /sI think it's more that perceptions of Mugabe in the West and in other regions of the world are very very different. The reaction to a lot of international news on Reddit makes a lot more sense when you realize how West-centric the biases are here. The damage was done to WHO like 20 years ago.Now remove Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. His blatant cronyism and incompetence caused this debacle. &gt;cronyismWhat connections does he have to zimbabwe? This looks like straight incompetence no more no less.old boys club consisting of the africans that facilitated the plunder on their continent post colonialisme.Mugabe  is was born in 1924 and entered poliktics in 1960. Tedros wasn't born until 1965 and didn't really get involved with politics until 2001. Trying to claim they are part of the same old boys club makes no sense.Why the fuck was it offered in the first place? I hear they only took back the offer so they'd have a spot open for Kim jong UnMaybe it was an EXTREMELY late april fool's?This is just damage control.Apparently someone in the organisation googled who he was /sIt’s obvious that Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the new director general, is a fucking idiot as a head of an organization. Wtf were they thinking appointing black Hitler as an ambassador?WHO is no longer credible until the people involved in this decision making resign or are fired...clean up this messMost WHO stuff is boring background medical stuff that isn't impacted by this one way or the other. Describing the entire organisation as "no longer credible" due to what in the end is a diplomatic screwup over a purely honory possition is deeply foolish.No you are hand waving dismissing it. What do you call an orginization without credible leaders and decision makers.A government.WHO hasn't been credible for years IMO.

Have an upvoteAm I nb4 “I don’t know, who did it?”Next up: Kim jung Un declared official world peace ambassador :PThe article doesn't say whether Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will be returning his bribe money.I wonder how ol' Robert "murder their arse if they're melanin-sparse" Mugabe is going to handle this one?WHO cancels Mugabe ambassador role?So this was in fact a legit position given to Mugabe.  Wow we are living in a weird world where Trump is a President and Mugabe WHO role.The darkest timeline.The thing that surprises me the most about this is... Did they think that no one would notice or care? Like... really? How fucking stupid are they?Next the U.N. will re-introduce cholera to the Western hemisphere, and cause a health crisis for lasting decades.        Oh wait, they already did that in 2010.Give it to Maduro insteadI don't know, WHO was it? I'm out of the loop.Wait who did? No, whos on first.WHO would do something like this?!The Who cancelled their Mugabe show
Finally. No more slogging through murky water in hip waders in a hotel room. 
There’s something fishy about the dad’s account. Firstly, what kind of father leaves his child alone in a dark alley? Or even in broad daylight, for that matter?  2nd, what on earth would make this an appropriate “punishment” for a toddler who didn’t want milk in the middle of the night?  3rd, was the child even alive when he left her body for the coyotes? I wonder.  I have many doubts about this sad case...Likely she was dead already, never put her out in the alley in the middle of the night. Drove her body to a culvert nearby, came home did laundry and reported her missing to the police.Edit: considering proximity to the disappearance and neighbor accounts of where the body was found, the body was likely recently placed there yesterday or this morning. The area the body was located was around a half a mile away and where two previous search teams that had searched this exact area according to neighbors.The body I think washed up to where it was found, due to the rain we had last night.That seems plausible as well. I've witnessed the local creeks rise 3-8 feet or more with substantial rain. We did have some rain overnight, but it didn't seem like a ton.Plus didnt a neighbors security camera film him driving off at this same time? If the father was lying, why wouldn't he say she snuck out of the house instead of admitting he forced her out?  He'd avoid the neglect charges Probably because it's easier to take some small fault and make yourself look innocent of a bigger crime. It makes him look like "yeah he did a bad thing but it doesn't sound like he killed her" versus "there's no way a 3 year old runs away, he must've killed her" but who knows.&gt;I have many doubts about this sad case...That's ok because you're just some person on the internet who only knows what information is made public.This is horrible. I hope they throw the book at her parents I think putting them in jail might be more effective than throwing books at them.I think putting them in jail while throwing books at them would be more than effective.Can we throw the kitchen sink at them while we are at it?I'm glad they found her :( I feel like he killed her &amp; let the coyotes have herFrom another article: &gt; Mr Mathews told the police that his daughter, who had developmental disabilities and limited vocabulary skills, had to be fed often as she was severely malnourished, and he had acted out of "frustration".&gt;He said he had found she was missing after going to check on her 15 minutes later. He told the police he had returned to the house and "did a load of laundry" as he was not too worried.He reported the disappearance only after sunrise.Even *if* the dad is telling the truth, at best he's a neglectful asshole who should have no part in raising a child. I believe they've already proved his car was being driven about that night in a way inconsistent with his report?  What he has admitted to is enough for at least manslaughter but I'm afraid the truth will be worse.Coyotes in Richardson? That seems odd. I guess I did read something about how they are adapting to live in more heavily populated areas though.I don't think coyotes have anything to do with it. The father (the prime suspect in her death) threw that out there as an excuse for what happened, and the media ran with it because it sounded sensational. My city is full of coyotes. They eat peoples cats and small dogs, so they have good eating and they don't need much space to make a den. ... peoples' cats and small dogs ...Punctuation can make a difference :-)People's*tYes. Lots of DFW has coyotes in the city.. One of the strangest sights Ive ever seen was a coyote waiting to cross the street in downtown Ft Worth in the middle of the day. I stopped at the light and he crossed right in front of me in the crosswalk. Swear on my nuts. We've got bobcats in plano storm drains, I believe coyotes in Richardson easily. Animals adapt much better than we give them credit forThe amount of rats, stray dogs, raccoons, and other creatures I’ve seen outside has noticeably increased in the past few months.Father was mollesting her and killed her by accident or intentionally then concocted BS cover up story.  Case closed. Now prove it.The case is closed remember? Here I will quote myself to remind you "case closed". If you want me to reopen my investigation it will cost you.  How much you got?
So here's the cut-and-dry facts, without any subjective statements by the officers:The man had dementia,  exited his car on the side of the road, and began walking/standing in the road. The article doesn't specify if he was pulled over or not. **Aaaand, that's it.** Everything after that is filled with claims by the officers, and they're not releasing the full report. They said he was enraged and combatitive, and they were afraid he would be hit by a car. How several officers couldn't subdue an 86 year-old man in that situation is slightly baffling.Why is an 86 year old with dementia driving a car?Because he has dementia? My grandad woulda driven far past when he didn't know his kids names and couldn't read anymore just because it was habit. Though maybe he would have forgotten how to drive at a certain point. Luckily we convinced him to sell his car before he went really bad but that was a 3 year fight. You're right he shouldn't be driving but it's hard to make people stop. Why didn’t you just take his keys? Like he’d remember. If only that were true...Dementia's challenge is that the person suffering with it seems to remember how to do dangerous stuff, but not that they ate 10 minutes ago :(It happens. One of our neighbors had to install door locks *inside*, because the husband would try to get in the car, or would wander off to the nearby park. If the wife got in the shower for 10 minutes, he'd be out the door and lost.can confirm...same with my grandfather...had to start hiding the keys in really good places to keep him from trying to drive off.File down the keys so they don't work. Insist they are the wrong keys so he keeps looking.This guy dementia’sBecause you don't lose your drivers license until after something bad happens. There is due process for being stripped of one's license. Family members can take physician's statements to the DMV to start the process. So many family members just don't want to suffer the blowback from doing so, which to be fair, can be pretty huge.If you have dementia severe enough to have your license stripped, you're probably going to hop in a car without it ever popping into your mind.True, but I was simply addressing the comment.It's a process though.And in practice that process almost never starts until after something bad happens.People generally have to actually display that they are danger to self and / or others before the system begins to remove their liberties. Not having a license doesn't mean anything to someone with dementia. You have to take the keys or the car if you want them to stop driving, but my point is that in the real world people don't take these steps to protect their elders and protect the community from them until after it has been demonstrated that they are an active danger.Because most people don't like giving up the ability to driveHe forgot he isn't supposed to drive.I worked in dementia wards throughout my 20's. Lots of angry patients, it's part of the disease, part of the job. Only once were we forced to subdue and redirect a confused and angry patient by calling security, and that was a nearly 300 pound man who had been newly hospitalized and was extremely agitated in his new surroundings. This old dude looks like he was 98 pounds soaking wet form his picture. shameful shit, but that's SC law enforcement for youI worked mental health too.  And heres the dirty secret that everyone knows.People are hard to subdue if they don't want to be subdued.Especially if you're trying not to hurt them.One guy stands out in memory, brought in my the cops to the ER I was working at the time.  maybe 160 lbs.  Stoked on bath salts.  It took 9 people to hold him down.  2 per limb and one on the head.  People can be strong.No comments about this situation here, I don't know the facts, but saying "you should be able to handle him" is a stupid comment that demonstrates that you don't understand physical restraint.Seconded. My grandfather had terrible dementia and lived at home with us in his last few years, he never weighed more than 140 lbs but when he got spun up and confused he was a fucking wrecking ball. People with psychotic issues fight with that scared animal strength where they put every ounce of their being, to the point of hurting themselves, into getting away or resisting you. I'm not saying I couldn't have taken him in a fight but trying to control someone like that and forcing their compliance is a very different task.Yep.  My grandmother died of Alzheimer's.  Before she did, she would get extremely combative whether anyone needed to touch her to, say, give her a bath or check her blood pressure.  She would kick and hit and even bit a couple of nurses.  In the police academy they demonstrate this by having one "suspect" resist being placed in handcuffs.  No striking back, just passive resisting of a recruit who is tasked with putting handcuffs on them.  Every minute, they add an "officer" to the pile.  It usually takes about 4 or 5 officers to get handcuffs on a person.  People should try it before they expound on it from their keyboards.You must be new hereAnd? So they taze or shoot the guy instead?Subduing people is part of the job. Don't like it? Don't do the job.Ever try it with an octogenarian?Ive seen two elderly old ladies doing crafts, get into a punching match and when an orderly came to separate the two they both turned on him and started fighting like their lives were in danger. When people suffering dementia are in a psychotic state its extremely difficult to control them, they swing everything they can at you. its extremely difficult youll get black eyes from a frail old lady whos on osteoporosis meds.But they had no right to handcuff an elderly man for being ill. Actually, they do, if he is a danger to himself or others.&gt; bath saltsalmost the same as someone not under such drug influence?Using the extreme example to make a point.Point remains.  I can beat most people in a fight assuming nobody pulls a weapon.  I cannot ensure they aren't injured.  If you want control of the situation you need more people.  Otherwise, shit happens.With respect, I don't care how strong you are. If you're 86, I can get you to the ground and hold you in place... You'd be more likely to break a hip than fight me off.I can't see how trained police officers would struggle here.go volunteer for a week at an Alzheimer home. go ask the orderlies and nurses how they got some of the bruises and how easy it is to control someone fighting for what they believe to be their lives.Outcome of this specific instance aside, do you think you'd rather break an old man's hip wrestling him or use a taser?Which would I rather? Or which do I think is less likely to leave him with brain damage?How about "Which one was essential?"&gt;Which would I rather? Or which do I think is less likely to leave him with brain damage?By whatever criteria. I'm unaware of any studies about injury frequency in uses of force but I'd love to see one.&gt;How about "Which one was essential?"Policing used to use a "least amount of force necessary" standard but it was determined to be an insufficient legal standard. It allows people to simply imagine less force being used without any grounding in reality.So what's your alternative? As much force as you feel like? Just use a taser, because it's easy and means no effort?The rest of the western world have police forces who are trained to de-escalate difficult situations instead of going straight to the most violent option they think they can get away with.&gt;So what's your alternative? As much force as you feel like? Just use a taser, because it's easy and means no effort?The current standard is an officer can use an objectively reasonable amount of force to lawfully arrest someone given the information available at the time. In this context, objectively reasonable means determined by specific facts and the capability of an average officer. &gt;The rest of the western world have police forces who are trained to de-escalate difficult situations instead of going straight to the most violent option they think they can get away with.I don't think American police are trained to go straight to the most violent option they think they can get away with. I've been through three police academies and that was not my experience in any of them. I am open to evidence to the contrary, though. My experience may not be representative.How much of your time in those 3 academies did you spend on de-escalation? (Genuinely curious) because I've lost count of the cases where I've seen the police make things worse.In one example, mentally disturbed man wandering up/down a street waving a knife and threatening people. Clearly a risk that had to be handled, however, the police drove up at high speed, stopped 10m away, exited their vehicle and when he lurched towards them, they shot him as "they were afraid for their lives".Of course, the street was empty by that point and they could easily have parked 40m away and not been at any risk whatsoever.I don't have training examples I can point to (although if you're aware of any course details online, I'd be happy to pore through them) but the results of the training (or lack thereof) are on display in the actions of police across the country.I'm aware that like you, my position is based on anecdotal evidence, but that's partly because no real information is available. I'll skip the mini-rant on use-of-force reporting as I'm sure you've heard it all before.American cops are trained to violently assault anyone that looks at them with the wrong eye, and they're protected from consequences by rich people who prefer that their wealth protection forces intimidate and assault poor people. This makes American society inferior.Breaking a hip is a failure, and we'd still a r/news story here, "Cops Break hips of unarmed 86 year old man for disobeying orders!"With that kind of a person you're flipping a coin on which is less likely to injure them.When you taze someone, they go down without being able to catch themselves. A simple fall is often enough to be life-threatening for the elderly.I take your point that no damage might be impossible but I don't believe wrapping your arms around someone and pulling them to the ground could ever do more damage than letting them faceplant.This springs to mind... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpV7qqhxZ_4&amp;t=43sMy point is that he's fucked regardless, and may have decided to avoid the thing that didn't work last time he tried it, and in 5 seconds chose one of two wrong options.He's in the wrong place now, and he's gonna be on the news regardless of what happens.  Either he's wrestling with an old black guy and being filmed for "police brutality" or he tazes the old black guy and its police brutality.I'm surprised he didn't just shrug get back in his car and drive away.You might be right about the rest of your comments but saying this guy looks small/weak? Dude has bigger biceps than me. Look at those forearms dude.Ive seen two elderly old ladies doing crafts, get into a punching match and when an orderly came to separate the two they both turned on him and started fighting like their lives were in danger. Next on /r/news:  Cops violently subdue 86-year old black man with dementia!!I hope it gets to the front page.Trying to wrestle someone on the side of a busy road is dangerous. There is footage of two Swedish girls who were detained by UK police for walking besude the motorway and they both broke free and ran into traffic, one hit by a car, one hit by a truck, all caught on film.The office was also fired from a different sheriff’s office and not recommended for rehiring. Look at how many highschool teachers go all school year breaking up fights without tazing or shooting anyone.&gt;How several officers couldn't subdue an 86 year-old man in that situation is slightly baffling.Restraining an old guy might require a bit of effort.  Tasing him just requires pulling the trigger.  When there's no consequences to police for tasing an unarmed 86 year old, why be surprised that they take the easy route.I'd be interested in a statistical study of what is more likely to cause significant injury, a wrestling match or taser use.well for what it's worth a hip revision is close to a death sentence for a dementia patient. That's my two cents. It's a tough surgery on the body, they'll never allow it to heal so it'll need additional revisions, and it just lingers until complications make things untreatable. It's like cataracts on dogs. They're untreatable problems because the patient can't be compliant enough for medical intervention to be successful. So to what you were saying, hurting an old person any amount is a real problem that eventually can snowball into significant injury. Probably the best method is whatever you can do to stop them as fast as possible so they don't struggle and get hurt further. So probably taser in this case. I agree. It's a tough decision to have to make, especially without the benefit of hindsight."might require a bit of effort"Well, what's wrong with that?  Need to work off the donut calories anyway."He's comin right for us!"This is a black man we are talking about. Clearly, this was a frightening situation for the officers involved. Their great restraint should be commended for not immediately opting to use deadly force./s, clearly.Just reading the title it’s easy enough to infer this was racially motivated. Protests against police brutality against blacks people exist for a reason, and this is one of them. I don’t know why people have such a hard time understanding the issue when stories like this happenWhat I want to know is how did the officers immediately ascertain the mans age and that he had dementia? Not to excuse anything that happened, but how?Well they didn't magically know his age on the spot, but they could clearly see that he was old.As far as the dementia goes, police officers see it all the time and know how to recognize it.That last sentence is just patently not trueThe majority of officers in my area recognize them by face.  Chances are, they have crossed paths in the past.  Same with the EMTs picking up alchys.Trying to wrestle someone on the side of a busy road is dangerous. There is footage of two Swedish girls who were detained by UK police for walking besude the motorway and they both broke free and ran into traffic, one hit by a car, one hit by a truck, all caught on film. People with dementia can be combative and incredibly strong. I can understand how tasing would be safer.EDIT: If the police had not tased him but instead try to catch this old man and he had run into traffic and been hit /r/news would be claiming police should have tasered him&gt; If the police had not tased him but instead try to catch this old man and he had run into traffic and been hit /r/news would be claiming police should have tasered himI believe this is true. These kinds of complaints often heavily rely on the benefit of knowing what happened.Don't care about this argument, but do you have a link for the footage you mention? I have a morbid fascination. article claims that cops tried to pull him over, he pulled a "360° turn" then pulled over before becoming "enraged..."[removed]The pure fact is that officers ARE typically less rough and don't assume the worst about white guys compared to black guys. So it's not JUST because he was black, but the fact is important because it is simply true black people are are more often wrongly pulled over or confronted by police and often dealt with more violently/with less empathy than white guys. Don't act like discrimination is a myth, that's just incredibly insulting to the millions of black people who have been saying that police treat them unfairly forever.    There are seen as a threat more often without having actually done anything illegal. There are more often looked at as suspects upon prejudgment. Don't pretend that this isn't trueYou know damn well the police would never have tazed a 90 year old white man for being confused. There is no situation where this was the correct action&gt;You know damn well the police would never have tazed a 90 year old white manhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKZS-l5T1whttps://nypost.com/2016/12/23/cops-tase-91-year-old-man-with-alzheimers/OOPS!any response to BasedBobRoss? "I was worried you'd get hurt so I hurt you."I have to ask: what made the man agitated? I worked as a medic for a number of years. Dementia folks are a different breed. It is possible that the police kindly ask him to get out of the vehicle...but what probable cause did they have? If they new he had dementia, where I live, they have you call an ambulance because altered mental status needs to be cleared medically before they can arrest you. So all in all, it would seem to me, regardless if the police had the right to pull him over, there are so many things else they could have done. If the man then speed off after being pulled over, then of course the police can pursue. But regardless, it seems that the police here have no common sense, purposely targeted a black man, and since "they were scared for their lives" they had to tazer him.I had to restrain a 400 lb black man who was over six foot in the back of an ambulance and who was high on pcp. The difference is, I didn't have to tazer him to do it. If you cant deal with the fears of being a police officer because "muh safety", go start working somewhere else. But truth be told, idiot cops are a dime a dozen.Back in the 70's when there was actual honest to god PCP around twice I saw cops deal with agitated guys on the stuff get cuffs on them and into the police car, by just talking with them for about 5 minutes.Yep, he looks menacing to me, taze ‘im!Why mention that he was black &amp; unarmed in the title instead of mentioning that he had dementia &amp; was in the middle of the highway?Nothing you said means he should have been attacked Of course, &amp; by the same token, his race &amp; the absence of a weapon does not preclude the possibility that violence was necessary. I'd be surprised if the cops did the best thing, but I'm not an expert nor have I seen footage.Because that wouldn't get as many clicks because it isnt as inflammatory.you don't think cops electrocuting a guy in his 80s with dementia is inflammatory?Not when they have to try and wrestle someone to the ground in the middle of a freewayPolice elsewhere are trained to de-escalate a situation. Why is that concept so alien in America?How would you suggest de-escalating someone who is suffering from a disease that removes their ability to think rationally or cognitively? You act like de-escalation is a switch that can be flipped, like the cops could have just chosen to magically convince the dementia patient to sit down and chillWell, first of all, you talk to them. If he's running in traffic, by all means shepherd him to the side but reaching for a weapon is an escalation. Failing that, these are supposed to be police officers. Are they incapable of stopping/redirecting traffic for a few minutes?Look at how the police in the UK deal with similar situations. They rarely use a taser even when attacked with knives. Not on a confused octogenarian(The one time an 80-year old was tazed, when his cane was mistaken for a sword, there was such a large public outcry that tasers were removed from many officers.)Like Pakistan?Dementia doesn't give you free license to potentially cause an accident. If he wouldn't comply and get off the highway, it doesn't matter why he didn't comply, he still needed to be removed.That all being said, I'm not sure how it was necessary to taze an 80 year old in order to move him. The lack of transparency is also suspicious.&gt; That all being said, I'm not sure how it was necessary to taze an 80 year old in order to move him....my point exactly...&gt; If he wouldn't comply and get off the highway, it doesn't matter why he didn't comply, he still needed to be removed.i'm sure there are ways that multiple police officers can do that which don't involve electrocuting a man who is nearly 90 years oldBecause this happened in the place where Walter Scott was recently murdered, where Dylann roof recently went on a killing spree, which is also full of confederate monuments, which is also governed by a long time member of a whites only country club. It's relevant.So if a white man is killed by black men in an area where there had been previous similar violence, the races would be a significant enough part of the story to be called out in the headline?I see. I think the dementia &amp; being in the middle of road &amp; allegedly aggressive is similarly relevant though, if not more relevant. Because if he was white and unarmed he even with dementia and being in the highway the police most likely would not have tased him.  Do you have any evidence whatsoever to support that?  This is the kind of stupid ass shit a Russian would say if they were trying to stoke racial divide.How would you know that? This is absolutely no statistical proof police use violence on black people more than white people so how about you stop talking out your ass, eh?Huh?  That is patently, outrageously untrue.  There are [numerous studies](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/20/health/black-men-killed-by-police/index.html) showing that minorities are disproportionately targeted for violence, and that when they are targeted, legitimately or otherwise, the level of force applied is greater.&gt;Jack Glaser, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley ..."It is very difficult, if at all possible, to generate an explanation for this pattern of results that does not include an influence of racial bias," Is it law enforcement's fault that black Americans commit violent crime at much higher rates than any other race?"Fault" is not a word I'd use, but law enforcement does target minorities in a way that inflates the statistics for criminal behavior.   There are numerous statistics, but off the top of my head the [Baltimore DoJ patterns and practices report](https://www.justice.gov/crt/file/883296/download) references this issue:&gt;Statistical evidence shows that the Department intrudes disproportionately upon the lives of African Americans at every stage of its enforcement activities.  BPD officers disproportionately stop African Americans; search them more frequently during these stops; and arrest them at rates that significantly exceed relevant benchmarks for criminal activity.  African Americans are likewise subjected more often to false arrests.  Indeed, for each misdemeanor street offense that we examined, local prosecutors and booking officials dismissed a higher proportion of African-American arrests upon initial review compared to arrests of people from other racial backgrounds.  BPD officers also disproportionately use force—including constitutionally excessive force—against African-American subjects.&gt; ... **Individual African Americans are far more likely to be subjected to multiple stops within relatively short periods of time.  African Americans accounted for 95 percent of the 410individuals stopped at least ten times by BPD officers from 2010–2015.  During this period, BPD stopped 34 African Americans at least 20 times and seven other African Americans at least _30 times_.57 No person of any other race was stopped more than 12 times.** One African-American man in his mid-fifties was stopped 30 times in less than four years.  The only reasons provided for these stops were officers’ suspicion that the man was “loitering” or “trespassing,” or as part of a “CDS investigation.”  On at least 15 occasions, officers detained the man while they checked to see if he had outstanding warrants.  Despite these repeated  intrusions, none of the 30 stops resulted in a citation or criminal charges.So we know, statistically, that Baltimore police (as an example, similar things have been found to be true in a great many cities, including Cleveland, Las Vegas, and Seattle) are _far_ more likely to stop African Americans -- even absent and justification to do so, meaning that law breaking black people are more likely to be caught than law breaking white people.&gt;... The database we created from hard copy stop reports reveals that BPD officers search African Americans at disproportionate rates.  During pedestrian stops, officers searched 13 percent of African Americans compared to only 9.5 percent of other people—making African Americans 37 percent more likely to be searched when stopped than other residents.  Similarly, officers were 23 percent more likely to search African Americans during vehicle stops.  These differences are significant beyond conventional levels of statistical significance &gt;... Search rate differences do not alone establish disproportionate impact based on race, however, because it is possible that differential search rates are driven by race-neutral explanations. For that reason, **the best measure of racial patterns in searches is a comparison of the rates at which officers find contraband during searches, or “hit rates.”**  A lower hit rate for searches of a particular demographic group is evidence that officers apply a lower threshold of suspicion when deciding to search members of that group compared to others. To the extent that BPD collects hit rate data, it suggests that officers’ search decisions are biased against African Americans.  Indeed, **BPD’s data on all stops from 2010–2015 shows that searches of African Americans have significantly lower hit rates than other searches.  During vehicle stops, BPD officers reported finding some type of contraband less than half as often when searching African Americans—in only 3.9 percent of searches of African Americans, compared to 8.5 percent of other searches.  Search hit rates during pedestrian stops also exhibited large disparities, with officers finding contraband in only 2.6 percent of African American searches compared to 3.9 percent for other searches—a 50 percent difference.61 These results are statistically significant.**And, similarly with evidence about searches. The link isn't working for me on mobile, but based on what you've pulled and commented this sounds both unsurprising and not great evidence for what you are trying to argue. You would expect African Americans to be searched more even if we lived in a world that wasn't racist in any way. That is purely based on current socioeconomic status. I'm not saying that there isn't bias in policing, but that any data that looks at raw numbers and doesn't control for socioeconomic status or area is hugely flawed if you are trying to make a causal claim. However the hit rate piece is interesting. I guess it could be that hit rates rise with income due to police being less likely to interact with higher income individuals but I'm not really familiar with that. That piece may honestly be the best evidence to support Bias. &gt;You would expect African Americans to be searched more even if we lived in a world that wasn't racist in any way. That is purely based on current socioeconomic status. I'm not saying that there isn't bias in policing, but that **any data that looks at raw numbers and doesn't control for socioeconomic status or area is hugely flawed if you are trying to make a causal claim.**The study explicitly doesn't do that.  It's quite long and I excised technical bits because, as you can tell, I was already quoting paragraphs of information.  Find the study (a Google search of "Baltimore DOJ Patterns and Practices Report" pulls it as the #1 result for me) and review it yourself if you'd like.Broadly though, your response basically boils down to, "studies can, in general, have problems and so I will assume this one does without evidence to justify that assumption."  It's a professional work product created by people who are experts in deriving exactly these kinds of statistics, and it's frankly silly to assume they're "looking at raw numbers" and not controlling for relevant factors.Further, your write that the "hit rate piece is interesting" as if it's an additional piece of information as opposed to what it actually is: a derived measure of bias designed to _specifically_ counter act the assumptions you're making about whether or not the study is properly controlling for variables.  As I quoted above, they say:&gt;These racial disparities suggest that BPD’s search practices discriminate against African Americans.  **Search rate differences do not alone establish disproportionate impact based on race, however, because it is possible that differential search rates are driven by race-neutral explanations. For that reason, the best measure of racial patterns in searches is a comparison of the rates at which officers find contraband during searches, or “hit rates.”**The hit rate evidence, which you yourself find useful, directly speaks to concerns you give in your first paragraph.  So why would you read the evidence and like it while also typing things like:   &gt;based on what you've pulled and commented this sounds both unsurprising and not great evidence for what you are trying to argueSince it's exactly great evidence proving that your hypothesis:&gt;I'm not saying that there isn't bias in policing, but that any data that looks at raw numbers and doesn't control for socioeconomic status or area is hugely flawed if you are trying to make a causal claim.  Is not applicable.Similarly, the paragraph I quoted about African Americans being stopped an enormously disparate number of times notes that the one individual who had _30 stops_ was _never charged_, which means that an endogenous bias whereby black people are stopped more because they are likely to have more criminality cannot explain that discrepancy.  Again, it speaks exactly to the concern you're raising.If you'd like more, the DOJ also says this, for example:&gt;As an initial matter, BPD officers arrest African Americans for several common misdemeanor offenses at high rates.  Although they make up only 63 percent of Baltimore’s population, African Americans accounted for: 87 percent of the 3,400 charges for resisting arrest; 89 percent of 1,350 charges for making a false statement to an officer; 84 percent of the 4,000 charges for failing to obey an order; 86 percent of the more than 1,000 charges for hindering or obstruction; 83 percent of the roughly 6,500 arrests for disorderly conduct; and 88 percent of the nearly 3,500 arrests for trespassing on posted property.&gt;Figure 4 – Misdemeanor Charges Per 1,000 Residents, 2010-2015 These disparities are even more pronounced where officers arrest individuals solely for a misdemeanor street offense, unconnected to a more serious charge.  In such cases, African Americans comprise 91 percent of trespassing charges; 91 percent of failure to obey charges; 88 percent of hindering charges; and 84 percent of disorderly conduct charges.  BPD also charged 79 people solely with “resisting arrest,” despite not arresting them for any other crime.  African Americans accounted for 90 percent of these charges. &gt;**The differential rates at which BPD supervisors release without charges or local prosecutors decline to charge BPD’s misdemeanor arrests underscore their discriminatory nature.**  To arrest for a misdemeanor offense, BPD officers must have probable cause that an offense occurred.  As – 56 –explained above, in some cases reviewing officials at booking or the State’s Attorney’s Office disagree with officers’ probable cause determinations and decline to charge arrestees.  **If officers apply a consistent, unbiased standard when making arrests, the rate of such declinations should be roughly equivalent across racial groups for arrests on any particular offense. However, our outcome analysis shows large racial disparities:  misdemeanor arrests of African Americans are dismissed or declined at significantly higher rates than other arrests**Which again, exemplifies not only the existence of the problem, but also highlights that the DOJ takes particular care to establish statistical measures that account for underlying criminality bias in the data.The article you linked does not support what you claimed. When looking at a group of ~2000 deaths, you can not then extrapolate that and create a per capita figure in regards to overall population, you should be looking at criminal populations within each race. Even in your article it says "*He found that, although white men accounted for the largest number of deaths*" - and since when does per capita mean much when it is dead bodies on the ground?&gt; "It is very difficult, if at all possible, to generate an explanation for this pattern of results that does not include an influence of racial bias," said Glaser, who was not involved in the new study.And this is just a straight up lie or an extreme case of ignorance. Try provide some better sources.Hold yourself to the same evidence standard you want from others.  You can't just decide the professor's opinion based on his expert analysis of the quantitative evidence is bs and expect others to respect that opinion without your providing some evidence.Your criticisms are either without merit or without understanding.  E.g. 2000 is a perfectly fine sample size.  Present specific methodological errors with sampling if you believe they exist.&gt; Your criticisms are either without merit or without understanding. E.g. 2000 is a perfectly fine sample size. Present specific methodological errors with sampling if you believe they exist.You clearly didn't even read and understand my comment - because I never said a sample size of 2000 was an issue. I said you can not use the results from that data and obtain a per capita figure based off of the *total population* - this is a misleading statistic.White Americans and black Americans behave differently, on average. Is there a reasonable chance that a senile white guy would behave differently towards some white cops than a senile black guy would? If so, what effect would this difference have on the cops' behavior? It's easy to pin the situation on racism, but sometimes the truth is more complex. You've made a claim about the most likely outcome there, but I don't think there sufficient data to make the claim reasonable. You do not know the cops in question. You do not know the old man in question. You do not know what role race played in the incident. [deleted]I'm not racist. Do you deny that there are behavioral differences between black Americans &amp; white Americans on average? They typically have different accents, different educations, different levels of wealth, different IQs, different crime rates, different music preferences, different diets... what planet have you been living on? edit: And to be clear, not only am I not racist, but I will attest strongly that racism is unethical.Yes I deny everything you just said, you fucking racist. Then you are wrong beyond reasonable doubt &amp; any social scientist worth their salt would agree. How many hours have you spent studying anthropology, sociology, american history, civil rights, and bigotry on America? Because from what I learned in undergrad you’re kind of wrong What am I wrong about? Do you think white Americans &amp; black Americans behave the same, on average? If so, then why do black American men commit about 50% of the homicide in the USA despite being only about 7% of the population? I can think of no more disparate a fact about the groups' behaviors. And do you think that black Americans &amp; white Americans have the same wealth? Do you think that they receive the same levels of education? What about health? Surely you learned about this stuff... stuff about inequality... during the education you brag about, right? edit: Please notice that I'm not even commenting on genetics here. Historical problems &amp; cultural problems carry a lot of weight in explaining these disparities. Genetics carry some weight, but I think culture &amp; historical trends are the big players on this particular issue. Citation needed then. Let me first address the elephant in the room. The kind of people most keen to share such information may be white supremacists. I am not one &amp; I despise racism. But so long as good, liberal people shy from science, I'm going to stand out in my willingness to look the truth in the face. I'll also add that for many fools, it seems that where there is smoke, there is fire, i.e. they will see "I am not racist" as code for "I don't want you to know that I am racist". I can do little to combat that here other than typing over &amp; over again about what a good person I am. You asked for a citation &amp; I have enough free time -unfortunately- to oblige. http://quillette.com/2017/06/02/getting-voxed-charles-murray-ideology-science-iq/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2014.xlshttps://nces.ed.gov/pubs2016/2016007.pdfI don't know of a scholarly article or government source to demonstrate that most country music fans are white, or that rap &amp; hip hop fans are disproportionately black. For most Americans, it goes without saying. It would be funny if the reverse were true though, right? Or if black Americans did not disproportionately like rap &amp; hip hop, or that white Americans did not disproportionately like country. The same goes for food, but I agree with you: it'd be interesting to see data on this stuff. I know it exists but I don't know how to get to it within a few minutes &amp; Google. &gt; different IQsOh boyFor real. My major was anthropology and this is one of the first things we learned: using “IQ” differences is racial bias because it isn’t even a consistent thing. But this sub is honestly infested with racists and “moderates” who think there is nothing wrong with claiming “blacks have lower IQs” (which means, according to them, that black people are lesser) but it’s okay!!!! Because these people think all of those previous statements are valid reasons for discrimination. They probably think kneeling isn’t actually about police brutality focused on minorities, because it’s too hard admitting they’re a racist when they can just lie to themselves and each other with bullshit “facts” which have been disproved in multiple fields.Agreed. I'm not sure why my comment was down voted but saying "blacks have lower IQs" is bullshithttp://quillette.com/2017/06/02/getting-voxed-charles-murray-ideology-science-iq/There can be "NO" possible reason why four able bodied cops can not handle an 86 year old unarmed man without resorting to weapons. If these little snowflakes can't do that then why are they working as cops? Who's next, a toddler? What a bunch of irresponsible scum bags.I'm playing Devil's Advocate here, but many people would argue that going "hands-on" is much more dangerous than using a tazer. A tazer is supposed to disable the person so they simply fall over. A struggle when you go "hands-on" can result in slamming someone to the ground, choke-holds, punches etc. **That being said,** there should be absolutely no reason *to need* to slam an 86 year old man to the ground. I can't imagine he's any stronger than a small child at that age. Grabbing his arms and just holding onto them so he can't move should have been incredibly easy.So... if he was charging them and trying to fight them... would they be allowed, in your expert opinion, to use a taser?I'll turn your question around. If you are one of four guys and a deranged 86 year old man challenges you, just how afraid would you be? If you answer that you are afraid for your safety and have to resort to a possibly lethal weapon in the case of an 86 year old man, then at my 125 lbs and 5'5", I am far braver than you and I am also 66 yrs old. If a family member tased their elderly father to get him to do what they want, the cops would "MOST CERTAINLY" charge them with elder abuse and rightfully so because that is what it is no matter who commits the act.Ive said this to another poster, until video comes out, I see nothing against tasering the man if he was violent. Go to a Alzheimer home that deals with severe dementia and spend a week there volunteering. Youll see frail old ladies fight tooth and nail for no real reason, the nurses and orderlies all get banged up and walk out with bruises and shiners. The people who care for these people are some of the most abused and under appreciated.You know what I saw in my relatives memory care ward?Male and female orderlies that could reasonably handle a combative person in such a way that they weren't hurt.  Why is it that 4 law enforcement officers can't do similar? The orderlies don't even get hand to hand training like LEOs do. To top it off the officers said the individual was jogging backwards after assuming a combat stance. So he wasn't even being directly combative at the time. I personally believe using a taser would be a better decision than getting into a wrestling match with another individual. Also you didn't answer my question.Only a complete idiot and coward would think it proper to taser an elderly person for any reason if that elderly person is unarmed. They are not capable of hurting four armed and trained men. Even if he slugged them with all of his power, it wouldn't even knock them off their feet or really bother them in any way. So, again, only a coward would need to do that for their own safety as well as the safety of others. Clear enough?And only a complete idiot would intentionally get into a wrestling match with an elderly person with zero knowledge about his intentions , mindset and possible weapons - and knowing that you (most likely) have a loaded firearm at your side. Also not knowing what diseases he possibly has, increasing the damage caused by a simple bite.It really sounds like you haven't considered all the possibilities.I've not only considered it, I've been involved in it. Not that hard if you use some common sense.Your personal anecdotal evidence means very little - and you havent actually addressed my original question, nor actually argued most of my points, why are you even bothering to reply?Apparently, you can not read or you can not understand what you have read.Yours is perhaps the stupidest comment I've ever seen on Reddit. And knowing Reddit, that says a lot.Home of the brave, everyone. Lmao[removed]This was four cowardly cops that did this. If not cowards, then just plain mean...Non-white elderly are considered fair game in America for abuse, they won't spare your parents or grandparents. They will degrade and abuse them 'til the day they die. There is no dignity in old age for the lower race-castes.I wonder how long it'll take bootlickers to infest this thread defending the officer. There is absolutely **ZERO**  reason to tase an unarmed 86 year old.Found the person with no experience in dealing with dementia patients and n9o experience physically subduing someone There are many reasons to taze an 86 year old.1.  You have a taser and the power to get away with it.2.  You 'have not had enough training' to not do this to a man 3 times your age.3.  He is black as the ace of spades.4.  He may have not had the presence of mind to avoid something provocative, like looking one of them in the eye.5.  Body cams and dash cams clearly show he was on PCP, take our words for it. OR All officers' body cams and vehicle dash cam footage have been misplaced.6.  You have done it already 50 times.  The '86 year old' detail gets media coverage just this once, for a little while, then all this blows over with no real consequences.I mean, there is a reason. If the 86 year old man/woman charges then they have full right too. However, while I doubt that was the case here. We should all wait to form an opinion until after all the facts have been released Article says he was backing away when he was tased because they were worried about traffic.  That is the statement from the officer.  Having the right to do something doesn't make it necessary to do that something.You're right. But there is still a risk of him harming the police officer. Therefore, I can understand why he did it (if he charged him or seemed like he was making a move). If not it was very uncalled for. But again, let's wait and see all the facts firstWe used to pay cops to take risks so we didn't have to.Now it seems they prefer to transfer all that risk to anyone who gets in their way and are still overpaid.A taser wouldn’t be the right tool. Cops are trained not to use them on the elderly because of the risk of cardiac arrest. At the same time though if you're a police officer and have trouble with an 86 year old perhaps you need to find another line of work. It's about risk dude. People can be surprisingly powerful if they go all out. Theoretically, police offers should be able to take down most people since they have training but they can't always. People panicking or going truly all out are very powerful. Even if they are skinny/old. Obviously since you don't know that you have no experience with it. Therefore, you shouldn't give your opinion too much credit If two people cant subdue 86 year old man, they have no business being cops.After _actually reading_ and then analyzing the facts in the article, I believe that the police officer did nothing wrong. He believed that the old man was a danger to himself _and others_ because he ran a red light to evade arrest, and did not comply with the officers' commands when he was being arrested.  Furthermore, he could have cause an accident because he was in the middle of the road. The quickest way to stop his behavior was to tase him because he was not listening to the officer's commands.   Yet another case of "police brutality" where the suspect isn't complying and it goes poorly.   This should not be a shock, no pun intended.[deleted]there were 2 cops and one of them was black.  I know that the police lie sometimes, but why are you assuming they are lying when you have no evidence to support this theory?Why should the officers have to put themselves in danger, however slim due to his age, just to subdue him?  When they could easily tase him and have the same effect?  What if he had a knife or other close-range weapon?  Nobody should have to assume this risk unnecessarily, not even a police officer.He ran a red light while evading arrest, and did not comply with their commands to get on the ground.  He was also in the road and could've caused an accident,  he was a danger to others.  And yet __still__ people are all upset because he got tased.  The mental gymnastics you people do is amazing.  In MANY of these stories about police brutality, the situation gets out of hand only _after_ the suspect does not comply with the officer's instructions. Why do you assume they are telling the truth? You are the one who claims wrong-doing.  The burden of proof is not mine, it is yours.  Let's just assume that cops lie 100% of the time, how about that?    derp.  There is no evidence to support your theory, and plenty of evidence to back up the account given by officers.  You  just saw "unarmed black man" and got triggered.I didn't claim anything. I just find it odd how adamant you are about evidence while at the same time requiring no evidence to believe the word of the police.  The word of the police officers IS evidence, unless proven otherwise.  Also, even the attorney is only raising an objection to the use of a taser, not the things leading up to that event.  &gt;The word of the police officers IS evidence,It shouldn't be.  They lie too often.   How often is that? Police officers' statements are admitted as evidence.  Their word is taken as true unless there is proof otherwise.  Who do you think that the court should believe, the criminals??  What is the alternative?  I support body cams and audio recordings of all police encounters.this is why police officers are held to a higher standard than an average person, have lots of background checks before employment etc.  This is also why cases of police abuse make headlines, because it's such an egregious thing.   Usually police try to be honest and thorough in their statements.  I say this even after having first-hand witnessed police lying during a court case I was involved in.Yeah you save the tasers for people with guns I guess.They use tasers so they don't have to beat the shit out of someone with a nightstick.More idiotic police bashing with no information.If you need a nightstick for a 86 year old, consider the hitting the gym and laying off the soda.Or not hiring women? I'm guessing you don't support that.You have no idea how decrepit this guy was, you're applying simple stupid logic that old people are weak and easily subdued.. Just like people saying global warming isn't real because it's cold outside. No fucking idea what you're talking about you just want to help your tribe win the argument.&gt;Or not hiring women? I'm guessing you don't support that.Wow just wow. I've seen plenty of women able to kick the ass of many men.&gt;you're applying simple stupid logic that old people are weak and easily subdued..Welcome to the cold hard reality of old age. Seems you don't want to accept it.so you're willing to accept the 'reality of old age', but not the reality that women on average are way less physically capable than men?  Weird how you pick and choose like that..did you think you sounded smart when you wrote this?I just see a hole in the argument - why,  what about you?i honestly wasn't even able to decipher the point you were trying to makeIt's a very obvious point, try harder.Then go post about how smart you are some more  - maybe itl come to you I don't believe for a second that an 86 year old is stronger than a lady in her 20s or 30s. Dodged the question..No he didn't.Yeah he was clearly the problem....youre stupid. [taser safety issues ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser_safety_issues) About 50 miles from where Walter Scott was shot in the back by an officer.But we don't need police reform in this country. Everything is clearly perfect. I'm surprised these pigs didn't blow his brains out. I cant take this shit anymore. "officers drew their Tasers “to try and calm him down so they could talk to him.”That is just not how that works. This is the cops idea of de-escalation? Perhaps pointing a weapon at somebody isn't calming?Now you see the violence inherent in the system.Tasing an unarmed 86 year old for his own self protection is ludicrous.  It's a new low for cognitive dissonance. Its amazing what articles they choose to add race in as a prefix to the job title...it's significant in states like SC where racism and race-motivated police brutality are endemicBecause the police wouldn't have tazed a 90 yo white man and you know itLol! My reaction as well. Not even past the first paragraph and were hit with "the white police officer.."The cops say he took up a fighting stance and started backing up onto the highway. Maybe he was putting his hands up and backing away because he had tasers aimed at him.The cops claim they tased him because they didn't want him to get hit by a car and he wasn't leaving the highway. But then you tase him, and now he's on the ground, being electrocuted/shocked, and *he's still in the middle of the highway*. They probably would have done less damage if they just grabbed him and dragged him to the side of the road. It certainly would have done less damage to the perception of police in this country.A person falls on his back/head and they move him? They make him sit up? These officers DO have emergency training, don't they?&gt; Probes from the device hit Chatfield’s chest and ribs, and he fell on his back, the report stated.&gt; The officers rolled over Chatfield, handcuffed him, then carried him to the roadside, the document added. One policeman reported putting his leg against Chatfield’s back so Chatfield could sit up.&gt; Barr told The Kingstree News that Chatfield wanted to “fight the police,” so officers drew their Tasers “to try and calm him down so they could talk to him.”Tasers rarely have a 'calming' effect. [Reminds me of the Oklahoma cops who tasered a bedridden old lady and claimed they feared for their lives because she had a knife.](http://www.allgov.com/news/controversies/oklahoma-police-taser-bedridden-86-year-old-woman?news=841039)One could surmise the old lady was drive-stunned since she had burn marks on her chest when she was finally seen by medical personnel.Police officers need more training and stop with the pain compliance tactics, just because someone doesn't readily understand, or heed commands. I firmly believe there's some room for discernment and patience in policing. Why is he driving if he has dementia??You answered your own question."Black Americans are more than twice as likely to be unarmed when killed during encounters with police as white people, according to a Guardian investigation which found 102 of 464 people killed so far this year in incidents with law enforcement officers were not carrying weapons.An analysis of public records, local news reports and Guardian reporting found that 32% of black people killed by police in 2015 were unarmed, as were 25% of Hispanic and Latino people, compared with 15% of white people killed.Also, 27% of people killed by police so far in 2015, were discovered to have had had prior mental health issues, including suicidal tendencies and schizophrenia."http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/black-americans-killed-by-police-analysis?CMP=ema_565Who else would they taser? You wouldn't taser someone who's actually resisting, that would be dangerous!ITT: people who would rather have cops wrestle a man in the middle of a freeway.Also ITT: People who would be complaining if the man was hit by a car and be saying "fucking idiots! They have tasers!" Reddit talking about police are moronic. Because these officers electrocuted an 86 year old dementia patient, it must be determined that no police officer should ever be trusted. &gt; no police officer should ever be trusted. No, just fewer should be trusted below the Mason Dixon line - or anywhere in the US, lbr - when they are interacting with black people.


When will the madness stop!?You can’t make this stuff up. 
Why does everything happen in FL?All reports are made public, is what I've heard. Apparently this isn't standard. Yeah Florida and like Utah or something are the only states where all police activity becomes public record automatically. Most states it's pretty illegal to report these sorts of things until after the suspect is convicted or even at all.Out of 50 one state has to be the worst state. We should build a wall and turn it into an official penal colonyI think Fidel Castro released a bunch of mental patients there a while back. Bath SaltsI'm so glad you said this.Yeah, that might get you arrested.Is one of her pupils more dilated than the other? That's always a good sign..White woman sets fire to a house, stabs an officer and has her day in court. 86 year old, senile black man walking in traffic gets tasered. I just don't get it. I read the headline before seeing the thumbnail and all I could think was, "please don't be white and pretty"... fuck. I'm pretty staunch in my stand that not all of America is racist shitburgers and then I read the article about the black guy followed by princess here... just god damnit. She's orange and pretty. Crazy how she is alive. She's only 26! Life, over. The title misses one important detail: She was trying to take back a teddy bear she gave an 18 month old child. Real class act.She's kinda hot.  I'd like to do some stabbin of my own, if you know what I mean. Dude, I suppose you found Octo-Mom hot too?  Until your whacko-radar is better tuned, do yourself a favor:  DO NOT GET MARRIED.Sadly, the voice of experience speaking.You don't have to worry about that, my dude.  I'm not ready to be making legal agreements and the like. I'm just saying the girl is attractive. I'm not dreaming about our vacation home in the Hamptons together, just a little pokin. I guess that’s okay, as long as you keep a fire extinguisher handy.&gt; *She's kinda hot.*You may want to put your opinion on hold for a while.That face is going to have few years worth of supporting the weight of large woman of color before you next get an opportunity at her.
I hope they were sorry it took so long."Canadian" and "Gangster" were two words I never imagined I'd read juxtaposed together.As a Canadian, gang violence is a huge problem for our major cities. They tend not to kill non-criminals, which is why it doesn't get as much international attention, but they kill each other pretty often.Mexican Cartels have recently decided to stop dealing with our local gangs and have started sending their own people up here. It's going to get ugly soon.
&gt;Godfrey added. "These officers are simply carrying out their duty to uphold the laws that Congress has passed."    Someone explain to her that you don't uphold the law by breaking other laws.Entering a home without a warrant is breaking and entering so they ought to arrest themselvesIkr. Just because you believe the person you're arresting doesn't have rights because they're illegal doesn't give you the right to break down their door.Not so fast:http://www.complex.com/life/2016/06/supreme-court-strieff&gt;The ruling maintained the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, which says that if officers have “reasonable, good faith belief that they were acting according to legal authority...the illegally seized evidence is admissible.”And if these ICE officers had prior knowledge proving the individual was in the country illegal, they could go after him. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_suspicion#Traffic_stops&gt;Reasonable suspicion is a legal standard of proof in United States law that is less than probable cause, the legal standard for arrests and warrants, but more than an "inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or 'hunch'"; it must be based on "specific and articulable facts", "taken together with rational inferences from those facts", and the suspicion must be associated with the specific individual.&gt;A police officer may briefly detain a person, without a warrant, if the officer has reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in a crime, and an officer may use reasonable force to effect that detention.Based on the information above it is reasonable to believe that these officers, even if they have violated the law, acted according to the good faith exception. They are not searching the premises... they are simply in the act of detaining the individual.   Regarding probable cause for probationers and parolees:&gt;In early cases in the United States, the Supreme Court held that when a person is on probation, the standard required for a search to be lawful is lowered from "probable cause" to "reasonable grounds" or "reasonable suspicion".Now this is conjecture... but how exactly do our laws and our rights apply to non-citizens given the fact that they change in many ways for criminals (like the example above)? If the person being detained briefly is a legal citizen then they will simply be released. The Good Faith Exception to the Exclusionary Rule requires a reasonable good faith belief by the officer that his actions are lawful. It arose in a case where police made entry based on a warrant signed by a judge or magistrate but later found to be defective. Because the purpose of the Exclusionary Rule is to discourage police misconduct, no purpose would be served by applying it when the police act in reasonable good faith.In *Strieff* [ https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/579/14-1373/opinion3.html ], the officer stopped the citizen without legal cause and during a detention lasting minutes ID'd Strieff, ran him through the police database which disclosed a warrant for Strieff's arrest, made the arrest, and discovered contraband during a search incident to arrest. The Court ruled that the stop was *de minimis*, not part of an ongoing police practice, and that the nexus between the illegal stop and the search was "attenuated" by discovery of the warrant, which was a judicial **mandate** for seizure of Strieff's person. Once the warrant was discovered, the officer was required to make the arrest.I do not think Good Faith applies in the case at hand, unless the premises were open to the public at the time ICE entered (in which case the entry would be lawful and Good Faith wouldn't matter). What does apply here is the requirement of standing. To suppress evidence, a defendant must prove that he had a personal expectation of privacy in the place or thing searched. Generally, short-term visitors or guests in another person's premises have no such expectation. IOW, the guy fixing your toilet can't assert your 4thAm rights if the cops illegally enter your home and find him in the bathroom with a severed head in his hands.Clearly, you've been absent these past few years.  Police officers have been murdering innocent people for years.  *decadesRemember labor unions?  *everAs bad as it is today, I think its still almost as good as it ever has been. People do shitty things when they're in power. Not that I mean to excuse the behaviour of law enforcement today.I'll second this, and add that it's probably better these days entirely due to technology and the Internet exposing police/authorities for what they've been doing for millennia. It's hard to hide police misconduct anymore.Spot on.  Most of Reddit has no understanding of history.  &gt;Remember labor unions?  No. Just like I don't remember railroad bonds.Innocent like Michael Brown?Innocent like Philando castille.He wasnt innocentActually, he was. A really decent human being, too. You could aspire to be as decent a person as Castille was, but people like you don't really aspire to great, or even good, things in life. You mainly exist to turn food into shit and blame those not like you for your lack of success or meaning in your miniscule lives. Your greatest contribution to the greater human quest will occur on that day when you take your final breath, thus freeing up that little bit of oxygen for the rest of humanity.I'm still trying  to grasp how breaking the law to be here makes you an undocumented immigrant and not an Illegal oneTechnically they are the same, the connotation is what matters. Entering without documentation is illegal as per law. Arguing about this is like talking about the difference in football and socceryou can't be an illegal person. you can be here illegally, but you as a person are not a thing that is illegalThe proper legal term is "illegal alien," which is used throughout U.S. Code. This is a perfectly accurate term to use and should not be stigmatized. It is what is.There are legal aliens as well, which can range from tourists here for a week to Green Card holders who live in the U.S. permanently (but are not citizens).Word games... I get the term illegal immigrant can be construed as dehumanizing but calling them undocumented immigrant doesn’t help either.... they are in this country illegally thus committed a crime. So you might say they are all criminals... Technically yes, but they still have rights. Undocumented makes it sound like they forgot their paperwork at homeNot "word games", law games. Being in the United States without proper documentation (current visa, green card, etc.) is not a criminal violation, it is a civil one. That is why we don't try and convict undocumented immigrants as we would when a criminal offense has been committed, we deport them because that is the legal remedy for this civil offense. Don't you think looking at this thread maybe we shouldn't dehumanize them? For fucks sake half the comments on this thread are saying illegals do not have rights. How far gone to have to be to view another man as sub human They don't the same rights as an American citizen because they aren't one. The only rights that belong only to American citizens are voting and eligibility to become president. All other rights apply to everyone within US territory. Except our Territories like Puerto Rico. As far as I know they're one of the only places you can't vote if you're an American citizen. Puerto Ricans still have every right that other citizens do. They are natural born US citizens fully. The reason they can't vote in national elections is because Puerto Rico isn't a member of the Electoral College. If you lived there, you'd be unable to vote too. A Puerto Rican is free to move to a state without restriction, and register to vote just like any other citizen that moves to that state.That's not how rights work.Rights are for all people not just American citizens. It's written into our laws. Your desire to strip rights from people is anti American &gt;Word gamesOr, you know, accuracy. [deleted]Why can't we just say illegal immigrant like we always have? Jesus Honestly, "immigrant" makes it sounds like the person has a path to citizenship (which is why people used "undocumented immigrant"). Call them what they are under U.S. law -- illegal aliens.It doesn't matter what some people think immigrantion means. What it actually refers to is movement of people between countries. Thus it fits the situation perfectly. &gt; you can't be an illegal personThats why they said "Illegal Immigrant". Not "person"Ok fine, they are here illegally. Which is a crime.I will just call them criminals then. Quit playing word games Ok...so being an illegal immigrant doesn't make sense because a person cannot be"illegal"...But some how a person can be "undocumented"...based on your logic how is it any different...a person isn't a document..Both are adjectives that describe their status, not who they areA person cannot be illegal, but their immigration can be. Hence illegal immigrant and not illegal personHowever in the English language we often shorten awkward phrases of the type "noun that has verbed adjectevely" to "adjective noun", thus "person that has immigrated illegally" becomes "illegal immigrant".  Might I recommend you drop your sociology/poli-sci/psychology/other-postmodernist-bullshit classes  and enroll in some remedial English.Right, they're criminal aliens.Buncha constitutional scholars in this thread!  The guilty looks on the agents faces, and the fact that the man they arrested was released should tell you everything you need to know.  I think there are folks implying that ICE officers should be allowed to legally do what they did in this video, which under US laws is trespassing and kidnapping if there is no search warrant or consent.  Apparently they would like to live under Soviet laws where the KGB could break into your home and snatch you away in the middle of the night with impunity."And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward."(Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn)People do like it, but only when they're on the side of persecutor, when they don't have to ever give a second thought that they will ever be on the other side.They think they'll like it. The type of person who would lead such a movement, doesn't really care about their followers. They're just tools. Imagine doing and saying the things Trump does. You'd have to be an utter narcissistic psychopath.When things inevitably go bad, they'll be pointed towards a minority to vent their misdirected anger.E: And in this country, they would be very wrong thinking that they could never be on the other side. They may have started something that will tear us apart in the end. This isn't Nazi Germany with a small Jewish population. And they are only a fraction of their "majority."This quote and quotes like it from the times before Mao's dictatorship and Hitler's dictatorship and Mussolini's dictatorship... Same line. "We didn't love freedom enough." "We treated the people who fought to keep us free like the enemy." The antifascist groups in Europe, multiple resistances in the USSR and in China? Stabbed in the back by the very people t hey were protecting.And then, once they were out of the way, the dictators' grand designs started to move.How many millions died because they said "YOU CAN'T USE VIOLENCE TO FIGHT THEM!" Or reported them to fascists and dictators' special police forces?&gt; Apparently they would like to live under Soviet laws where the KGB could break into your home and snatch you away in the middle of the night with impunity.They are the same people who support tRump. Of course they support Russian/Soviet policies. Does that mean we can kidnap Republicans and deport them too? If they are illegal immigrants, sure. Political affiliation is irrelevant.Remember that as a juror you can refuse to convict if an illegal immigrant "murders" an ICE agent./r/news is pretty racist.  That, or it has quite a few bots.  Or both.Racist bots.Russians pretending to be Racist to sow discord among Americans."pretending" to be racist..Racist Russians pretending to be Americans, I thinkEver since the moron was created the racists have brigaded /r/news.It gets a lot of traffic from t_d whenever there's a story they need to manipulate.Why is it that if I break the law I get prosecuted, but if they break the law it's a "training issue"? I learned at a very young age that ignorance of the law is not a defense. If people who are supposed to enforce the law are ignorant of the law and break it, they should be prosecuted as an example to other people in their position. That is the exact same reasoning that the so-called "justice" system uses as an excuse to fuck us in the ass every time they get a chance.  Unless and until there are consequences for their illegal and unconstitutional actions, their illegal and unconstitutional actions will continue.&gt; I learned at a very young age that ignorance of the law is not a defense.Depends on which side of the badge you're standing on, apparently.This stinks like last week's fish.  What is this, East Germany, the Soviet Union?Here we have ICE agents pushing their way into a private residence and committing trespassing and kidnapping because they're unwilling to simply wait for their suspect to leave the property and arrest him on the street.Was it getting close to quitting time for the agents, or what?  These agents seem lazy, stupid, and unaware of their violation of the constitutional rights they're sworn to protect above all else.  The real question is whether their superiors are aware of these tactics and condoning or suggesting them, which is likely the case since this isn't an isolated incident.  That is repugnant.&gt; The real question is whether their superiors are aware of these tactics and condoning or suggesting them, which is likely the case since this isn't an isolated incident.ICE works for the President, so yes, this unconstitutional behavior is condoned and directed from the top. My theory is that ICE has always attracted people that are racist nationalists, and have much deeper penetration by that subset of our population than most other agencies. The election of Trump has emboldened these people to commit illegal acts like this because they literally feel America is under attack by Mexicans and that our way of life is being destroyed by them. The current administration is making things worse by basically looking the other way and refusing to prosecute these rogue agents for their illegal and unconstitutional acts, and that just feeds power back into their illegal actions.&gt; racist nationalistsUm, a significant number (35%) of ICE agents are of Hispanic descent? Maybe they don't want illegals in their country either?Maybe you can be Hispanic and nationalist and yes even xenophobic?You absolutely can. My grandma, mother, and uncle all legally immigrated here in the 70s and they're unified on their opinion that people shouldn't be able to skip the line. We're not hispanic though.What the agents did here is clearly wrong and illegal, but that doesn't mean we should jump to the conclusion that ICE agents are generally xenophobic at large. The practice of harboring immigrants who are technically illegal and allowing them to just hang out in the US as long as they please is a BIG middle finger to those who choose to spend the time and money to become actual citizens of the United States of America. Think about the message that's sent to people who complete the citizenship process when they see a friend or acquaintance who never bothered to go through said process and enjoys the US life all the same. Why bother becoming a fully fledged citizen?They *should* be fired. Or at least docked pay to send a message to everyone else in the agency. But they wont. And fewer people will care then they should about the privacy and 4th amendment violations going on because they were targeting *the right people.* No, they should be prosecuted.ICE agents are hands down the worst human beings I have ever met in my life. They are thugs in a power trip who are to mentally unstable to make it as cops and to much of cowards to join the military. They are people who get off on the idea of hurting people weaker than them. No one cares less for the law than ICE agents  I felt pretty good on that bullshit stop on I10 the last time I drove through there. This ICE agent was staring down my Corvette while they were running their drug dog around it. I looked him in the eye, told him he is an idiot for thinking there are drugs hidden in a Corvette and if their fucking dog jumps on my car I'm suing them for a new paint job and don't fucking look at me like I'm some criminal, I'm old enough to be your father and I pay your salary. Show some respect.  Fucking bunch of punks. I was with you until...&gt; I pay your salaryPlease don't be one of those people who says that.Yeah, please don't tell the truth about being a taxpayerDid everyone clap as you drove away?I kinda doubt it. The only people who could hear me were the cop at the booth-thing and the cop running the dog around my car. The dog kinda jumped towards my car on the passenger side rear 1/4 panel which prompted me to make the comment about my paint. My insurance company had also just paid $8k to repaint my car after I drove through Nevada and got caught in a nasty dust storm.  There was over a mile long line of cars. It was hot and it was fucking ridiculous that they were impeding the free movement of citizens like that so that they can get a few drugs or illegals. It's goddamned bullshit. Point being, that I'm fairly certain people would have cheered if they heard my comments to the cops.  And, most certainly, some would not. There are people who would rather give up their freedom for some fake security. They prove it time and time again.&gt; told him he is an idiot for thinking there are drugs hidden in a CorvetteHe would have assumed you were too stupid to smuggle drugs after saying something like this.Yeah. Keep thinking that, sweetheart. Jesus Christ, fucking idiots like you are everywhere.Driving a corvette, or any other car, has absolutely nothing to do with whether you may or may not be smuggling drugs. Why would you possibly think that drugs can't be smuggled in a corvette? Wait, you mean that an authoritarian fervour will result in people's rights being violated and escalate situations to extremes that didn't exist before it? Wonders never cease.And the supreme court has already ruled in the past that the laws of the US apply to all immigrants, regardless of legal status. Whether or not this man is in the country illegally has no bearing in how law enforcement must act. They do not get to cut corners when it suits them. If they are going to enforce laws, then ICE must know and follow the laws themselves.Disgusting.  I'd have called the police on them.  Great use of resources too.  4 idiots harassing some painters only to detain and release one of them 90 minutes later.  This country is fucked.ICE are Federal law enforcement agents, good luck getting some local cops to arrive, all the ICE agents have to do is flash their badges and the cops will drive on.We do seem to be circling the drain at an ever increasing speed, don't we? :(Does ICE have the same rules when it comes to searches as the regular PD? I know the DNR can enter your house without a warrant, under certain circumstances. Just curious.Yes, the fourth amendment applies to ice, just as it applies to all government agencies.  &gt; Does ICE have the same rules when it comes to searches as the regular PD?broadly speaking. as a federal agency there are some slight differences, but most of what you would think is the same, is. &gt; I know the DNR can enter your house without a warrant, under certain circumstances. the DNR can come onto *private property* without prior notice in certain circumstances. that's legally very different from entering a *residence.*this is completely reasonable if you know how public resources interact with private property. to give an example; the power company doesn't need your permission to work on its pole, despite it sitting on your land, and they have a limited right to use your property to access it. what those limits are is a matter of rather fine legal detail that varies with where you are. the DNR is similar. they have a limited ability to move about private property in their stewardship of resources held in public trust. If this were my home I'd sue the shit out of ICE. They can wait the fuck outside and follow the law in the 4th amendment which is far more basic and important than immigration law. I'm not a fan of illegal immigration and think this country has had ridiculously incoherent policy and enforcement on it for decades, but if we expect them to follow the law, the LE better damn we'll follow the law too. I fucking hate smug cops.Replace this headline with someone coming to "take yer guns" without a warrant and see how the other side reacts. Suddenly barging into homes without a warrant isn't such a great precedent to be setting.My guns are undocumented.  They wouldn't know I had them. If it was an illegal alien that had a gun I don't think anyone would be upset.ITT: Law enforcement *could* have followed the law. But laws are so inconvenient, and don't apply to LEO's, so what are you all so upset about?right we can all see the same comments you're reading tooI suppose what gets me the most is the way these ICE agents lied.  How we get such untrustworthy people in positions of power is beyond me.  I'm a zero tolerance sort of fella when it comes to cops bearing false witness.  One lie and they're out on their rear.  I feel the same way with sleazy politicians.       If you don't own/rent a home, there is no illusion of privacy.  If you don't work, there is no illusion of value. I wish I was being sarcastic.I don't think that is true, you might have less but you still have some.r/im14andthisisdeepr/imsomuchsmarterthanyou/r/ilikereferencingsubredditsr/threadICE ignoring the law.  I’m so surprised. How can someone with this job go home to their families and feel like they've done an honest days work? When you prey on the fears of others, when you trespass, when your entire career is about being a dishonest cunt, there is nothing but sleepless nights and guilt for you. Shame on anyone who claims they work for our government who speaks to other Americans this way. I'm glad these guys got handed over to OPR.And Republicans still deny america is heading in the same direction as Fascist Italy or Hitler's  Germany. But What I just read in that article was some truly shutezstaffle shit. Ice should be ashamed.You do know deportations were going at an increasingly faster rate under Obama right?And surely you realize that nobody here is deriding ICE for deportation, they are deriding a federal agency for breaking the 4th and 14th amendments of the Constitution.Ok, not the guy you were responding to, but afaik this stuff was still happening the past 8 years and we very rarely heard about it. Us tinfoil hatters have been called tinfoil hatters for saying that we have been stepping toward a police state consistently over the past two decades that I have been remotely involved in politics; it started under Bush and kept steamrolling on through during Obama. Now that we are destabilized enough, it's going to get worse faster.Not pointing fingers, but I think ICE itself might have some serious issues that need sorting - their offices function very independently of one another and rarely are working on the same things, so just like some PDs there will be some particularly egregious offending groups of them with the usual systemic corruption.The difference is that they are not getting warrants. Isn't this just an ICE fuck up and not really related to whoever is in charge of the government?  Law enforcement not following the rules happens with every government.I support legal immigrants by kicking the illegals out. And also because fuck the cartel, who force people into a huge debt and force them to work as slaves in the US or risk having their families killed. If their families aren't held hostage they were likely used as sex slaves and robbed of their possessions. One thing that made me support Trump was getting to know an illegal and how his family was being held ransom. He was being forced to worked at a Marriott hotel and send most of the money to cartels. Absolutely disgusting but this is why we need to be tough on immigration and private companies. Destroy the slave trade by destroying the supply AND demand. Supporting ICE will help with that goal.But this? This only destroys American values by giving government the power to enter homes and arrest without a warrant. Everyone needs to receive equal justice under the Constitution. Do it the right way.This is exactly what 2A is for.The state is becoming more and more tyrannical as of late.  Cops are almost invincible.I can't wait until someone truly wants to take our guns. Judging from this incident there's already precedent for unreasonable search and seizure by government agents, even though it blatantly violates the 4th Amendment. Grabbing those guns will be much easier."Nobody's rights were broken because illegals don't have any rights".  /r/conservative's take on this.Too bad that ICE agent didn't get shot for breaking and entering.Unfortunately I don't think that would have been a better outcome. More than the criminals would have been shot. The people inside the house they were breaking into would likely end up dead too. Come on man, you're advocating for a human being to be killed. I don't agree with their actions and something does need to change but wishing for another person to be killed is downright sick.Well, if you support undocumented entry, guess you can't complain. Lol.I don't so I can. He shoudlnt have done that. I know all you ‘constitutional conservatives’ (racists) get hard in your tighty-whities when an illegal gets deported, but you really should think hard about giving the police blanket authority to come into any house without a warrant. Could get tricky when the gun-grabbers are back in power some day.Good news is a supreme court decisions uphold self defense in no knock raids where you shot them(officers) coming in your home.  If they don't let you know that they are cops you are allowed to defend your home.  Yeah but if you shoot one the ones behind him with their automatic weapons come in blazing, shooting everything in sight. Hard to defend your rights in court when you're dead.Of course if your illegal you likely don't have a licensed firearm which means you are still fkd.Way to generalize us, comrade politruk.Giving a shit about the constitution makes people a racist? This is actually what communist like AbsurdTime believe, these people want to dismantle the framework of our society.&gt;Giving a shit about the constitution makes people a racist?Although he was less tactful, his point was that you can't pick and choose what part of the constitution you want to defend.So if you're a staunch defender of the 2nd amendment, this should upset you as it's a clear violation of the constitution. Illegal immigrants have rights under the constitution. Illegal immigrant is not a race.&gt;Could get tricky when the gun-grabbers are back in power some day.Eh my guns aren't illegal.  They are undocumented.  And I somehow don't expect police will be going door to door for as much as the left hates them. How ironic that people are arguing ICE agents can't enter a home without permission, but that it's fine for illegal immigrants to enter and stay in the country.Edit: Not tired of winning yet.lol that is a good one. Of course both are wrong.&gt; How ironic that people are arguing ICE agents can't enter a home without permission.Well, the thing is ICE agents have gotten things wrong before and have deported legal immigrants, and even US citizens (for example, [this](http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/06/us/texas-colombia-teen/index.html)). They could come after you even, and then claim its a mistake. Are you sure you want that to happen?A single example of an ID-less run away from 2012, does not really make a compelling case to eliminate ICE... Repeatedly violating the constitution and abuse of power does.No, it means there needs to be more transparency, accountability, and oversight. The same things we need with the police (and government) I'm sorry but I don't see that happening unless the girl refused to identify herself, I find it hard to place the blame on ICE when it could've been prevented merely by telling them her name and having them contact her mother. Hundreds of American citizens have been illegally detained or deported by ICE: http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/22/504031635/you-say-you-re-an-american-but-what-if-you-had-to-prove-it-or-be-deportedLorenzo Palma repeatedly asserted he was a citizen, and even provided proof in the form of his grandfather's birth certificate showing El Paso as the birthplace, but still spent years in prison on an ICE detainer awaiting deportation.ICE has never cared about the law. This happens all the time Then surely you can find a better example. I left when my visa expired, as I should.Edit: Haha downvotes? Did people want me to stay illegally lol?[removed]Which is bad. As is illegal immigrants. Can both things not be bad?I didn't say they couldn't, but cops breaking the law to catch criminals is not justified. It just makes more criminals. You're comment reads as though you're saying it's okay because they stayed illegally which it's not.If they don't respect the law and enter illegally they can't complain too much when the law is broken to deport them.That is cool.------So you're saying law enforcement agents should be held to a lower standard than illegal immigrants?Because ICE violated the 4th and 14th amendment.Are you arguing that because there are people in the US without legal permission to be in the country that ICE agents should be allowed to enter any private home to search for them?  Maybe I'm misunderstanding you.He is saying it's ironic that people are upset about the illegal entry of the police officer but not about the illegal entry of the guy getting kicked out. If you want to enforce laws you have to enforce all of them. I think he's saying both are wrong.This is, literally, one of the dumbest things I've ever seen anyone try to equivocate.Really.They are pretty much asking why we hold cops to standards above criminals.he was gilded, too. pretty sad.r/negativewithgoldThe best goldAmerica is the constitution. Without it we're just a bunch of losers like Russia.So support it or stop pretending you aren't third world fascist garbage.I support it; 1A, 2A, all the A's. But I don't support illegal immigrants If  you support what ICE did here, then you don't support the Constitution.No, you don't. This was a violation of the 4th and 14th.Stop lying.Ironic that you dont realize that anyone on our soil (illegal immigrants included) are protected by the Constitution. And here I thought you were someone who loved what our country stands for. I didn't state anything like that at all. Stop trying to misquote people.You are right.  You did not state that you love this country. It's obvious you don't like what this country stands for if we go by what you said. Ice agents need permission to enter your home. It's the law.  Illegal immigrants are protected by our constitution, so that law applies to them. Thanks for the laugh though.  It seems like you don't have a problem with illegal immigration. Staggering. What's the problem to be had?  Illegal immigrants are a net boon on our economy.How are they a net boon?[removed]You have low reading comprehension And your trolling skills are as garbage as everything else you believe.Good to know they can completely ignore some laws, but when they're close to getting caught for it, they can hide behind others to avoid the consequences.That's the America I know and love. Gaming the law for one's own benefit.The ends sont justify the means.If you're okay with ICE doing things without a a warrant and breaking constitutional laws, why can't any law enforcement do the same to catch criminals?Why not allow the government to use cell phone tower spoilers to intercept calls, messages, and locations because they suspect someone is breaking the law?Why not allow the government to place cameras everywhere to monitor the police the public for law breakers?If you're okay with ICE doing this without warrants, then you shouldn't be opposed to the government allowing law enforcement to break into anyone's home who they suspect is breaking any laws.&gt;The ends sont justify the means.&gt;&gt;If you're okay with ICE doing things without a a warrant and breaking constitutional laws, why can't any law enforcement do the same to catch criminals?&gt;&gt;Why not allow the government to use cell phone tower spoilers to intercept calls, messages, and locations because they suspect someone is breaking the law?&gt;&gt;Why not allow the government to place cameras everywhere to monitor the police the public for law breakers?&gt;&gt;If you're okay with ICE doing this without warrants, then you shouldn't be opposed to the government allowing law enforcement to break into anyone's home who they suspect is breaking any laws.That sounds like the last 8 yearsRekt.  Reddit is so pissed at you right now for that factoid.Haha I know, those same people will be besides themselves for the next 7 years so it's all goodSo by your logic the cops should be able to gun down anyone suspected of a crime because criminals kill people?  That just turns this country into africa where the person with the biggest army controls the land and war is quite common over there.Well that's a huge leap right thereseems like some Nazi Germany shitWhat stops an American from shooting an armed individual not identifying himself entering his home?
I live in Fort Walton Beach and one of my friends dogs were shot by this asshole. People suck and I agree with the other comment that said people like this are psychotic and will upgrade to worse crimes. When Renton does it, it's seen as becoming a functional member of society after kicking heroin.Back in the 70s/80s this sort of behavior wasn’t all that strange for kids, and it was a “you darn kids!” sort of deal, then the kids would get reprimanded and  not arrested. That being said, this was some kids and one young adult in arrested development, and violence with guns of any kind will not fly in the modern world. He got greedy. We all know you just do one every two weeks or so and not at people.Lol, I've shot my 60fps bb gun at random passerby's as a kid.  Got yelled at pretty bad by my mom when she found out.  Never did it again.  surprise surprise...a fat kid.We need to end obesity now or else more events like this may occur. /sWent to high school with this kid. I was a senior and I think he was a freshman at the time, but in 2015 he had brought a gun to school to kill himself at some point through the day. He had shown the gun to a few of his friends and the school had taken him into custody. It's a shame some people don't learn their lessons.Edit: I was a Junior at the time.He is a killer in the making. Add him to a watch list Oh noooo! Teenagers with BB guns. Someone call Homeland Security. you joke but these are the kinds of folks that graduate to mass shootings so hopefully they can get him some helpThis is an article about a kid that was driving his car while others shot his BB gun out the window, at least that's what he claimed. Sounds way more like dumbass kids being dumbass kids (remember the paintball scene from 8 mile, and how funny it was?) than it sounds like potential mass murderers to me. Quit being afraid of everyone and everything. Yes, they're brats. The exact kind of disgusting little shits who grow up to make the world a worse place. But a group of early teens being annoying is hardly front page news now is it? Regardless they caused thousands of dollars in property damage and theres no telling what else they damaged or pets they shot at. Just saying, thousands of dollars in property damage is *very* easy to rack up considering that information is decided by insurance companies. When I told them he wasn't brown they hung up.  I guess we'll have to just keep living our lives. So if you are a white 18 year old you are a teen?  Say 18 out loudEight-een. Military Soldier, say that out loud...I still don't know what your point was supposed to beDo you call a soldier a teen? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!You've got some issues to work out, dude. Of course you only have to be 18 to serve. Hell, family members of mine snuck in younger. But it's apples and oranges just to jump there I thinkit was spot on, your relatives must have been WWI, because I am pretty sure you can't do that in the last 50 or so years...WW1 and 2. And just because it's harder doesn't mean it can't happen. Regardless: just because you're 18 doesn't mean you're a soldier. In fact, I'd wager more 18 year olds aren't soldiers than areIs this a trick question? Teen is literally in the number 18, you stupid fuckAn 18 year old is called a man in every media story, you fucktard!  Especially when it involves a black MAN.  At age 18 you can vote, go to war, get married, etc. you are considered a "man" not a "teen."  So what your telling me is all those pornsites with 18 year olds are lying to me and they're actually all men. Buying porn and legal weed, thaks, I forgot those two..Lapse in logic. 
I hope it didn't get Harry Connick Jr., he loves him some JambalayaThat's pretty shitty news.I hope everyone gets better.I wonder if the bad cook knows who they are.

Not the demographic you wanna target. They have the government and the American public at their backs.Well, there are whole industries that prey on servicemen; especially in military towns. This one only got in the spotlight because the bill collecting harassment was so over the top and people posed as attorneys and threatened court-martials.Don't forget the for-profit colleges that do their best to get the servicemans GI money in exchange for an absolutely worthless and overpriced degree. I'm looking at you University of Phoenix They are the demographic you want to target actually. Anyone who's been in the military can vouch for how much money new enlistees foolishly throw around and waste on booze, cars and girls they can't afford.A military man could rape everyone in his family and neighborhood and everyone would still defend the crap out of them.That's not remotely accurate. If a service member does something to betray their community with a crime they usually have the community demand blood for their actions. citation needed since the past 16 years of war tell a different story.
And now they have one cashier with a really long line.So business as usual for Walmart.The problem is that they cant get workers to show up for a job they hate. Every Walmart store in the country loses millions because they dont want to spend a little more to keep cashiers and keep them happy. They probably lose a full 30-40% of their potential customer base just because they cant keep enough cashiers. I'd be shocked if Walmart hasn't run the numbers for if increasing wages would be worth it.That doesn’t sound right.  I’m sure the off-the-cuff Reddit criticism is more accurate than studies done by Walmart.I generally agree with your point, but man, I can't go to a WalMart because every one I go to is in total disarray, crap everywhere.  It gives you the feeling that the store just doesn't give a shit.  The employees are the least helpful people.  It's just terrible.Once every couple of years, I'll end up going to one because there's the convenience of being able to buy things that I would normally have to go to two different stores for.  Every time I leave, I realize why I hate the place so much.I'm sure their business is more efficient by not spending the money to get me as a customer.Put yourself in the employee's shoes. You have a department that you have to keep neat and tidy and you have these trashy slags come through and fuck it up every hour. So now you have to not only clean their mess up, you have to put up your freight that just came in that morning. While that's happening you're being paged by one of the 8-10 jerk off managers to go help another department do their job. After all that's said and done you're being bitched at by another manager because you're not getting your own department's shit done. I worked at that hell hole for 10 years and this happened on a daily basis.I agree.  That's why I said that their business is probably more efficient by not spending the money to get me as a customer.They're understaffed, so the place looks like a warzone, so I don't shop there.  They could spend more money to hire more staff, and I would shop there, but there aren't enough mes to justify hiring more staff.It helps if you teach yourself to view the walmart as less of a store you shop at and more of a post-apocalypse survival training camp with low low prices.they could keep their low prices and still hire more people. Those things aren't mutually exclusive. the parking lot is a fucking nightmare. I lasted 16 months there. I was written up for being friendly with the customers since they we're complaining about their low friendly score with the customers and eventually terminated for asking a customer that almost ran into an elderly woman with her cart to please watch where she was going. She went off in a huff and puff raving mad and spoke to my manager. When my manager called me into the office I explained what happened and she didn't care one bit. She said that me telling the customer that was rude and showed zero concern for the elderly customer that was just standing still shopping when this woman came storming through. From my point of view, if I was the elderly woman I'd have wanted someone to say something. We are all one blood and as such have a duty to look out for one another regardless of race, age or sexual orientation and/or identity. &gt; because every one I go to is in total disarray, crap everywhere.I've noticed this depends on if the store is in a bad part of town. I sware it depends on the area. My local one is very clean with nearly nothing out of place. Another 20 miles away is basically a shit show.I know of one that is clean and well-stocked. Still a shit-show. Man every Wal-Mart I've been to is nice, has stuff in the right place, is clean, and during the day has several lanes open.The only annoying thing is all cashiers are gone after like 9 pm leaving *only* the self check out, no matter how many people there are. But it's still worth it to not deal with people as I shop.I've traveled extensively throughout the South. I've been to some places in  Philly, NY, NJ,DC. I've never ever had any issues at walmart. They always seem identical and organized. IDK where this circlejerk sprung from? You people must be all going to walmarts in Compton or Gary,IN. It looks like a war zone because of staffing. They are notorious for staff not being able to take breaks etc.Wal-mart is a logistics company, not a customer service company. This happens to me as well, the last visit was it for me. I will drive 15 minutes extra to go shop elsewhere  than go to the Walmart 5 min away from me. Well compare Walmart to Costco if you doubt. Wal-Mart - $485B in FY 2017Costco - $129B in FY 2017It's not like Costco has any success with that model. I'm sure that the profit margin for the Walton's isn't the most important thing Again, you don’t get to be one of the biggest companies on the planet by not caring about profit margin or other financial markers.  In fact, you could easily argue that profit margins ARE important to them and that is why they don’t hire more workers or pay them more.I should clarify. I don't mean profit margins for the business. I mean profit for the Waltons themselvesThey have, and found that keeping wages pathetically low keeps their employees on welfare and food stamps which are mostly used at, you guessed it, Walmart!So not only is Wal-Mart offloading 75 percent of the cost of their employees on the taxpayer, they get the rest back when those employees go shopping.Gee, that almost sounds like a scam!not wages, more hours. Full time, benefits. Never happen, Walmart is very anti-union. You get fired if you even utter the word, the supervisor has to report it. It's why Walmart's don't have meat departments anymore, tried to unionize, now all meat is prepackaged and shipped that way.You don't need a union to do those things, and honestly doing all that would decrease the risk of unionization. But maybe Walmart believes it's cheaper to be more heavy handed with reacting to union efforts.They want to be sure there is no risk for unionization. Maybe this is their show of force in a senseThe problem is that the organization has essentially indoctrinated itself to the point that it wont even entertain the idea. Anyone who speaks up or even attempts to do something like this would be immediately viewed as some sort of activist and would be shunned or even let go. Reliability bonus.  Walmart's base are the decision makers who only care about price and want the cheapest goods.  Though I think this move is a little risky for them with intentional or accidental theft or someone accidentally pays for an item.  Really, there is no need for it.  I would think that if you created a scanner system that does the ring up on the conveyor belt instead of the actual person in the line ringing it up one by one.  Maybe requiring all packages to have the barcode on multiple sides to prevent it.  Maybe a bluetooth reader where ever box has a chip and it reads it. [Citation needed]can confirm. First job was at walmart. Hated it. Rage-quitted. Best decision I ever made in my whole life. Source? This sounds interesting if true.Wal-Mart used to give really good compensation to its cashiers, back when it was run by Sam Walton - some of his early cashiers got stock options, which turned out quite well for them...That explains why my last in store pick up order of a single item took a few days to be ready. The Walmart we duck into for odds and ends we need that day has 4 or 5 cashiers and 6 to 8 loss prevention people standing there. Is this due to a majority of customers not wanting or knowing how to use a self checkout?It's slower than having a cashier if you're buying a lot.This is true and I feel like never comes up.Yes, when I'm buying a basket of things I prefer self check out because I can do it faster.But if I have a full cart of groceries, it is absolutely faster to go to a cashier. Until you have the little old lady in front of you paying half in change and half in personal check and carrying an envelope bursting with coupons to 50 different stores, so then you have to wait for her to find the 3 coupons out of 1,000 that she can use for this purchase, write out that check because she didn't bother to fill out anything prior, and then count out the remaining $9.63 in a combination of Susan B Anthonys, a two dollar bill, 3 quarters and an assortment of nickels and pennies. I bet some people stopped reading this comment and just went to the self checkout instead.This seems very accurate.I work at a store for a while. Most of our stores complaints were about self checkout and lack of registers open. Customer after customer wanted less self checkout and more cashiers. My store installed double the self checkout. Customers even complained while they were being built. Walamart doesn’t care about its customers. Worst part is the employees got blamed for the poor customer complaints and suffered in their bonuses. I must be one of the few that rather have self checkout. My job in sales revolves around human interaction all day long. The last thing I want after work is to deal with more people. I just want to grab what I need an leave as soon as possible.I personally don’t mind self checkout. I’m just pointing out that Walmart ignored their customers in favor of having to employ fewer people. Same here. I usually scan and bag and do the job a lot more quickly than having to wait in line dealing with ineptitude of humans. Give me more machines any day!&gt; I must be one of the few that rather have self checkout.No most people probably enjoy them. But some locations have more older folks who *don't* like self check out and a business should be able to understand what their market is like in certain parts of the country.Where else are people who shop at Walmart going to shop?  It's already the absolute worst shopping experience possible so at this point their customers will put up with a guy who's job is just to slap items out of shopper's hands. This is why I love Aldi. Quickest checkout in the world. It's amazing. Lidl is super awesome too.The hours I shop they literally have Zero and just expect you to do the work. ditto where I live. At night there are no cashiers. Just self checkout and one cashier that stands there at a nearby station and watches you.  I laugh, because i have honestly never seen few cashiers at walmart. There are long lines, but its like, people with full ass carts taking their sweet time putting stuff on the counter. This is long lines with sometime 6 or 7 different cashiers. And i have seen this occur at three different walmarts in san diegoYou need to travel then. I live in Arkansas, the state Walmart started out at and is headquartered in, and all the Walmarts I've been to only have 2, maybe 3 cashier lanes open *on a good day*. And this is in the supercenters. They all look like shit holes too, by the by. Don't know what walmarts you go to but I have NEVER been in a walmart outside of the holidays where every register had someone working there.  It's usually like 50% with lines backed all the way down the aisles.6 or 7 lines is right around 60 percent for me.Sounds like a Costco.they should make it to where you just finish at a self checkout by plugging in the scanner, paying and getting your receipt. sounds like my local ica.When you think about it, shopping is incredibly inefficient. You put your items in the cart as you shop, take them out again to checkout, put them back in your cart after paying, and then take them out to put them in your car.I'm all in favor of anything that can reduce this inefficiency and make the checkout process faster.[Amazon's got a store](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16008589011) where you just go in, pick up what you want, and walk out, which is exactly how it should be. 10 to 1 they implement this at all the Whole Foods they just bought.If it gets out of beta.  Right now it's only for employees whom they can punish more than the average random shoplifter.I hear you're forced to drink a verification can every time you check out That’s why, in the future, there will be machines that scan everything in your cart and the chip that’s inside your hand and charge everything automatically as you walk out the front door. No cashier needed. That's nice but I still need to move things from cart to car, then car to house. Find a way to let me put things from shelf into car and drive away.  Then I'm down to just car to house.Now just find a way to let me put things directly from the store into my house, and you have cut out all the extra overhead steps.... and that's Amazon "classic".Amazon is amazing and all that, but there’s people (maybe I’m in the VAST minority here), like me, that actually like to get out of the house every now and then. I like to do my shopping offline. Then I have an excuse to get out and do something instead of staying at home watching Netflix. Maybe I’m just totally crazy though. You could go bowling. Or take a walk in a park. Maybe there's even more things to do outside than Walmart.Stop and Shop (North East US chain) has handheld scanners for customers to use by the front where you get carts. Pick up a scanner, scan everything you put into the cart (viz reusable shopping bags in cart), then go to check out line and pay. I'm not sure people are capable of being trusted beyond that.Alternatively, they also have a home delivery service, but I prefer to pick out my own foods.Unless you're physically handicap in some way, I don't get how that's an issue. I just pick up items, scan, and put them in a bag in one single swipe most of the time. I don't see any other way to bag items and scan quicker than that. You're still doing all of that unless you don't plan on using bags. I see nothing wrong with this though. Better than having to estimate with a calculator.We've had this in the UK for ages, and it works really well, the queues are much shorter now.The biggest Dutch supermarket chain also has this.same in Sweden the self scanner don't even have a q half the time.We do? I'm in the UK and have never heard about this.Do you live in the Outer Hebrides or what?Uh, no? Yorkshire.I've used self-service checkouts, of course, but not ones where you can scan items while you're shopping. It seems like it would be really easy to steal something with a system like that, so that's why I'm surprised by its existence.Do you need a posh smartphone or something? What supermarket chains are this technology available at?Tesco's do it (used this in Kent, East and West Midlands tends to be the big big ones that do it), no smart phone needed just a club card. Usually a little section by the door just scan your club card and you get a designated scanner. Then just scan the items as you walk around the shop and put into your bags sets pre set up in trolley then go to the special self scan checkouts and pay.As to stop theiving you have a chance to be randomly searched when you go to pay, seems to be like every 1 in 3 trips.&gt;  the queues are much shorter nowIsn't that a bad thing in the UK?We respect the queue, but we hate being there. I thought it went:Step 1: Join QueueStep 2: Ask what Queue is forspend an hour shopping, followed by 20-30 minutes trying to check the hell out because 1-2 registers open... i welcome this, like yesterdayThe problem is getting workers to show up. Nobody wants to work for Walmart. If they paid more and taught managers to behave less petty, they would have FAR more customers. Theyre only saving maybe $200k a year, but theyre losing twice that every month because nobody wants to shop there anymore. Cutting employee costs has severe unintended consequences. &gt;The problem is getting workers to show up.No, it's not. I've worked at two supermarkets. Yes, there was a problem with calling out. No, it didn't severely affect checkout times, because other people from other areas of the store were called over to run register in the meantime.The problem is inadequate staffing and a captive audience. Walmart is cheaper than other places, by a lot. This means it gets the segment of people who can't afford to go other places as well as the segment of people who would prefer to save over shorter wait times.Regardless: it's an absurd claim that they're losing customers because of this in any significant number. They're Walmart. They have this down to a science. If it cost them money, they'd put another cashier in. It doesn't cost them enough money to be worth it.The fact that the customers get totally screwed here is irrelevant to the bottom line, which is all they care about.Walmart employs 2.1 million people in the US.  200k a year would be less than 10 cents a year per person.  You are correct that walmart has a worker shortage though.  But most businesses have a worker shortage right now.  Paying more would help but labor is a huge part of business costs.  Walmarts profits roughly 6 mil a year.  So 3 dollars a year more for all employees would wipe out all of their profits.Walmarts profit is actually ~$13.5 billionSource: http://quotes.wsj.com/WMT/financials/annual/income-statementHe meant individually by store, I think, and that's approximately correct. After all overhead costs, profit ranges from 4 to 10 million.if he meant it per store why did he bring up the global employee count and then figured out the cost of that. if he went per store then 10 cent increase per hour would cost the store an extra what like 10 bucks an hour total? if a single store even employs 100 employees.300 employees at mine, some have almost 500even then that's still nowhere near 200k per store annually for a 10 cent increase.Alright, yeah, I understand that. Just a matter of whether or not it's worth it, and corporate decided no, it wasn't. The already have a base pay of $9 starting with a bump to $10 when you finish Pathways, a sort of computer based training here. Then some hourly positions are $15.15 base, with pay caps that you can reach after many years in the 20s.Do I intend to stay? No. I don't want a career here. Is it okay, and worth staying til I progress through school? Yes.none of that really matters to me. i was simply commenting on how misleading it is to drop numbers for the entirety of the walmart corporation, then use those numbers as a stick to exaggerate how much it costs to raise workers wages. is it worth it on a single store basis? maybe it isn't i dunno. but manipulating the numbers is what i was commenting on.If I understand correctly that 13.5 billion is before dividends to stockholders, bondholders, and reinvestments.  From my understanting actual profits after all of that brings it down to millions and not billions.  I mean yea technically a payout to stock and bond holders is profit but without it no one would invest.  And yes technically money reinvested in new stores etc is profit but without it you can't grow and hire new employees correct?  True profits are what I am talking about.  You are partially correct, Walmart did technically have around a $1 billion cash deficit last year but looking at their previous cash flow statements it seems like an anomaly caused by a $4 billion dollar principle repayment along with $10 billion in stock buybacks. From 2014-2016 they increased retained earnings by ~$5 billion a year.  So basically 5 billion a year would relate to less than 1 dollar an hour raise on all employees?6 million a year hahah walmart makes WAAAAY more than that. like 3 orders of magnitude more. their profits are in the billions.They are absurd when it comes to understaffing. It's not a shortage of workers it's their business model. &gt; but theyre losing twice that every month because nobody wants to shop there anymore.Good thing they pretty much ran out most competition in many towns.My walmart trips have been fewer recently. Mostly because who ever manages our local walmart just sucks. The produce sucks, deli selection sucks. The people suck.You honestly think that Walmart wants to have more lanes open but can't due to people not wanting to work there? LolWalmart has as many cashiers as they need at their stores. The reason there are so many lanes with so few open has to do with the way they budget the construction of their buildings.They purchase the equipment for their checkout lanes in huge bulk orders, then they defer maintenance on the belts and checkout equipment. What they do instead is rotate use on the checkout lanes and distribute the wear and tear on the machines over the lifespan of the store.The advantage of this approach is lower upkeep cost and lower investment on equipment. But they also have a gazillion checkout lanes for busy times of the year when they need a million cashiers. The reason walmart chooses to have so few cashiers for most of the day is because they're a shit company that cares more about SPLH than they do their customers or employees.They're betting that you will stand in line once you've got your hands on the thing you want to buy.I love using the app at Sam's Club. Just walk in, scan my stuff as I pick it out, then waltz out of there all like, "Adios suckers standing in line." I wish all stores had this option. I do not want to stand in line and deal with slow checkouters. Great.  Another labor cost that Walmart is pushing onto their customers.  Do I get a discount for not using a checker?  No? Then shut the fuck up and ring me up.Any Walmart I have been to has about 25 checkouts but only 2 of them open at any time. So I would rather check myself out and breeze through self checkout rather than stand in a stupid long line. I usually hit up a Trader Joes instead if I can though...I just dont shop at wallmart, but half the time the machine fucks up anyway and the lady comes to help.I hate that, it makes you have to wait longer to NOT buy your things at the place you aren't.Narrow aisles, tiny checkout stands so one must almost hand the cashier items one by one to be scanned.  Meh.Self-checkout is God's gift to introverts. Three minutes from walking into the store until I'm walking out without having to interact with another human.Thus, the entire purpose of self-checkout is defeated if everyone starts using them. I pray that they'll keep self-checkout machines inconvenient and cumbersome to use for the average Muggle so that people like me with my 2-3 item basket and no fear of machines can breeze through while everyone else stands in line.They are brillant aren't they? They took them out of my local Jewel and drove me straight into the cold, dead arms of Wal Mart. &gt;Self-checkout is God's gift to introverts. And people buying condoms.  My local Albertson's got rid of their four self-checkout machines recently.  Too much of a maintenance headache and they needed one or two employees to hover around them anyway.  The 10 cent bag fee was probably the last straw.THANK YOU, never had a problem with them. I can usually scan my shit and be out of there quicker then someone who's been standing in the tobacco aisle for ten minutes.But then the poor schmuck they have stationed at the self-checkout area says "have a good day!" as you pass them on the way out.Options:  A: suck it up and return the meaningless socialismB: ignore them and feel a little bit guiltyC: tell them you used the self-checkout specifically so you wouldn't have to talk to anybody, that they should consider this is probably true for many to most, that they have spoilt your shopping experience, and that they should consider this fact vis a vis the corporate policy that makes them spout such banalitiesThat's literally Walmart's business model. Cut costs everywhere. Pressure distributors with their plus one policy. Reduce prices based on economies of scale. This is capitalism 101. Either provide a superior product or provide a cheaper product. Walmart also acts as a monopsony because its the only company that can buy products at that low of a price from its manufacturers. At Sams club, they have self checkout stations that require inserting your membership card to activate.  After that, you can use a hand held scanner to scan the items you plan to purchase.  After that, you put the scanner in its station and then pay for your purchase.Since I arrange the items in my cart such that all the UPC labels are exposed, I can actually scan my items and pay for it more quickly than I could otherwise by going to a checkout station that has a cashier (since the cashier has to take the items out of the cart to scan them).Personally, I would rather go with a system that allows me to complete my purchase faster than I could otherwise.  Then again, I suppose that there are people who prefer that others do things for them even though it actually takes longer than it would otherwise.Sam's also has an app.  You never need to go near the checkout at all.  Use your phone to scan the items as you get them, check out with your phone, walk out of the store.That's what I do, it's the best. If I ever remembered to bring bags with me it'd be the easiest shopping experience for sure, without bags it's real annoying.The giant that I shop at has this and I love it. Makes check out so much faster when you're just scanning as you goLook up Walmart Savings Catcher. They will match any local competitor on prices automatically for you. So yes, that labor cost is making them the lowest prices and if it isn't they will give you the difference back automatically.The Walmart near me stopped doing price matching in any form 5 days ago.Same here. No more price matching.  I was told it would technically do the same thing (kinda) but you have to buy the item at full price and then scan your smartphone savingscatcher app at the checkout (or something) and it takes it off. Or it gives you the money in the form of a voucher for a future purchase. This completely fucks over older shoppers who dont use smartphones (or computers).Note: I dont have a smartphone, but I think you can just enter the receipt number online to get a voucher to use later (you have to print out if you dont have a smartphone to show). I dont have a printer. :\I REALLY dislike the idea. I prefer to have the self checkout station monitoring employee just manually price match my stuff right there. You get a discount relative to the store that has enough cashiers to not have long lines.  You get a discount on how much time it takes waiting in line.They already do this in Sams Club and it is amazing!  I hate going to the grocery store normally but going to sams is alright with me.  My wife hands me the stuff I scan it and I get a running total of our cart so far then when we are done I checkout on the app and we walk right past all the mess.  Love it Walmart has to check the items after you pay to make sure a shopper is not stealing so that sort of defeats the whole purpose.  They’ve always done this though I thought. That’s why they have a “door man” right?I've never had a doorman stop me in walmart to check my cart. Only sams club/costcoEven at Costco, they sort of just glance briefly at my receipt and cart and put a check mark on it. The only time they thoroughly checked was when I went to a newly opened location.I think the only time they actually check my car at sams club is if I have beef in it. Make sure I rang it up and didn't like ring up another item twice to the get number right. Otherwise they just count Costco is looking for high dollar items or items that represent a lot of their theft issues.I've had them make me move stuff around so they could find the item they wanted to check specifically.Rarely have I seen them actually check. Either way I just walk past them at any store, or past the shitty stolen merchandise detectors that always go off at other stores.You have no legal obligation to stop for any of those people if you haven't stolen anything. If they physically attempt to stop you, you've got a super easy lawsuit on your hands.The only thing they could do is revoked your membership (at Costco for instance) but you're still not required to stop for them or help them do that in any way.&gt;You have no legal obligation to stop for any of those people if you haven't stolen anything. If they physically attempt to stop you, you've got a super easy lawsuit on your hands.While that may be true, when you sign up for a Costco membership you agree to let them check your receipt and bags before leaving the store. So they already have your permission to check, and can revoke your membership for failure to comply.&gt;If they physically attempt to stop you, you've got a super easy lawsuit on your hands.Even tho you don't.  They have every legal right to physically stop you.&gt;you're still not required to stop for them or help them do that in any way.At Costco you are as you agree to that as part of your membership.&gt;They have every legal right to physically stop you.No, they do not. They can only stop you if they physically saw you take something, and then walk to the exit without paying for it. At no point can they have lost sight of you in that process.If you paid for everything you grabbed, then you know for a fact that they have no legal right to be stopping you. If they do, it's an easy as fuck lawsuit and whoever stopped you is at minimum losing their job if not going to jail.&gt;At Costco you are as you agree to that as part of your membership.Which does not give them a legal right to stop you, all they can do is ask for you to stop and if you don't they can try and look up your membership number from their registers and cancel it. They still cannot forcibly stop you.&gt;They can only stop you if they physically saw you take something, and then walk to the exit without paying for it.Thanks for agreeing with me.That's not agreeing with you. If you didn't take anything, you have no legal obligation to stop which is what you were trying to argue against.Yes it is.  And do you really think a shoplifter is going to stop because they stole something?You're first point was."They have every legal right to physically stop you."That is patently false. They only have that right if they know for a fact you are stealing.If you did not take anything, you have no reason to stop for them because they absolutely do not have proof of you stealing. Any attempt by them to stop you will be an easy lawsuit.&gt;They only have that right if they know for a fact you are stealing.I know hence me saying they have the legal right to physically stop you.&gt; You have no legal obligation to stop for any of those people if you haven't stolen anything. If they physically attempt to stop you, you've got a super easy lawsuit on your hands.One time the Wal-Mart security guy kept accusing me, followed me out to the parking lot, and stood behind my car to prevent me from leaving as he called the police and waited for them to show up.You can just walk past them, they are not a government entity and have no rights to search your belongings. Once money exchanges for those products they are your property.I rarely see checkers anymore. But most of the cameras seem to be at the front of the store and at self-checkouts.My supermarket does this scan as you go thing, and they seem to randomly audit bags at checkout. The kiosk makes you wait, the attendant comes over and scans a bunch of your items to make sure they're scanned.  It's happened to me once now out of maybe 10 trips where I've used that scannerMassive piece of missing information here: Closing the loop / online-to-offline. By using an app on your phone, Walmart is now able to connect your digital identity with your offline purchasing behavior. When done right, this allows ad platforms work with Walmart (and advertisers) to know if that $500K Tide campaign P&amp;G ran through doubleclick, to which Google knows you were exposed, made you more likely to buy Tide in store. This type of measurement is one of the holy grails of digital advertising. Right now brand advertisers in the CPG or consumables space have a real tough time measuring the real impact of their ads on offline purchasing behavior. On top of this, the app checkout method allows Walmart to connect your online interest and purchase intent data to personalize advertising to you within the store, as well as cross-sell to you live within the app based on items you are already placing in your cart. They already do this if you buy items online and offline with the same payment card. convenience has its price, who would have thunkit.I am pretty sure that Demolition Man got it wrong.  Its Amazon versus Walmart for all the marbles. "I have a store, you come in, you pick what you want, you bring it up you ring it up then you get the fuck outta my store"I've been doing this for years when grocery shopping. You get a handheld scanner and go about your shopping. Get an item, scan it, place it in your bag and when you're done shopping you swipe your card on the scanner to pay (or tap your phone on the scanner) and head out of the store. It's a fantastic system and it means I don't have to deal with lines and I can bag my own items how I like them.What scanner do you use?The one the store has. They have a wall with scanners hanging in it. You pick one up and go shopping and replace it when you leave.the one that looks like a star trek phaser... at least used to.If I could shop, scan my items as I go, and pay from the same device AND then walk the fuck out. Man, the future. Smart Carts are next. Just put your stuff in the cart and walk out with it. Paid for and receipt in your email automatically when you exit the store Kroger has had this for a few months now at least. I really like the idea.This is will good. I hate lines that is why i do my shopping early in the morning.I stopped in Bentonville (I think), AR, near the corporate offices, while visiting family two years ago and picked up some stuff from Wal-Mart. They had these scanners and a drive thru to just send in your order and pick it up that way. I can say thats the best Wal-Mart experience I ever had.You also need to have a personal account. If you are buying a pack of cigarettes and a six-pack of beer every day, you can be certain your health insurance provider knows it.Can't wait for this. I hate that they close down self checkout at 11pm. THIS is something I like! I HATE using self checkout as the monitoring employee watches me like I am a thief or something. Edit: shit... it is only canada. I dont have a smartphone so I cant use it in the US.Note: one thing walmart recently did. Stopped the price matching with other stores. Pissed me off. People will just go to that other store to get the better deal. In my experience, the Walmart scanners are terrible.  I will always go to the cashier.Got my eye on you, Neishia.wait, how is this going to stop people from buying a bunch of stuff while in the store aisles, and putting something they didnt buy in their cart (hidden by the other products) and then just showing the receipt to the greeter (for the US version of this where they use their smartphones)?  Is the greeter going to look though your receipt and then dig through your full cart to make sure everything you have you paid for? No. So this is going to create a lot of petty theft of small items.Why have employees when you can make customers do the work. Hell, ya don't even get a discount when you ring yourself out.They aren't paying me to do the job of a cashier.....Then wait in lineBeen doing this in Sama Club for awhile now. We had scanners at the Stop and Shop near us. For the longest time though you still had to wait at a normal self checkout at the end. There would always be that people that REALLY should just use the normal checkout making the self service kiosk guy scan all their items while anyone with an "UNEXPECTED ITEM IN BAGGING AREA" sits there stuck. Now that there's a special self-scan checkout it's great! I can put in my deli order right at the scanner station and wait for my number to be called. Makes shopping a total breeze when you don't get stuck behind other customers anymore!And now Walmart will have even more detailed information to sell. Yeah, this will endear Walmart to their customers.They already make it miserable to try and leave their store.I used their regular self check-out once.  I had some high dollar items.  They had someone stand right next to me and stare while I checked out.  It was so obvious that this girl had been tasked with making sure I didn't steal something and it made me really uncomfortable.I haven't been back.Apple did this years agoThis almost seems like a step backwards for Walmart. Ya the idea is great but they were originally doing "Pick up at store orders" which sounds way better. Here's a box of stuff you want and here's the bill. Done gone. Why don't they just do it like they do it with their other store, Sam's?Scan and pay with your phone and just fucking walk out. In the article it says they do that at 10 American Walmart stores. This scanner thing is in Canada. Guess they're just working out the bugs for a nationwide roll outnot everyone has a smartphone. I hear constant complaints that people don't know how to use self-checkout, this is just going to make it worse. Imagine when someone scans an item then doesn't want it, already takes a minute or so to at the self-checkout, if the employee isn't busy.I remember using this 10 years ago.  It's nothing new.We've been using their online ordering and picking it up at the store at a designated time for a few months.  No issues/problems, it's already bagged and paid for, you park right next to the pick-up door, and they load it into your car.  There are no additional costs and tipping is not allowed.For some reason self checkout pisses me off. I get it, automation. Still it's so incredibly easy to steal in self checkout but I guess they figured such losses would be less than paying wages to people.How do they keep people from abusing the system?  Scanning the small size of an item, then sweeping for the extra large size?  Things like that.Makes sense, target cartwheel makes it a pitaAnd here we are, on the road to more and more automation every single day. See, it doesn't matter what wage you make, many Walmart workers make on average $8.25 per hour and they are STILL getting replaced with technology.It wouldn't matter if they made $1.40 per hour like many workers in China.This is how capitalism will undo itself if it isn't checked, remember consumer demand makes up 70% of the economy, even in an ultra financialized "neoliberal" economy such as ours.Remember, robots don't buy things.No consumer demand, no job growth. No job growth, no fucking economy.I buy all my health and beauty products online, specifically eBay. When you buy in bulk, four or five items at a time, you can save a lot of money and time. The last time I was in CVS, there was one cashier and a complicated return in front of me. As I stood there wasting time, I realized shopping at home was much easier. I only went to the store because there was a coupon and then I realized I saved even more money using eBay anyway. Cool. Still not going there.I'm actually a huge fan of this. The cashier usually forgets to scan the most expensive things. I'm a crappy cashier.Good, most checkers there drag ass and Id rather not have to deal with them. Im in and out way faster doing it myself.America's largest employer is *rapidly* adopting automation. The "immigrants are taking our jobs" story is falling apart and folks who truly rely on Basic Income as their saviour should really look at how welfare programs are already viewed and realize the funders of a UBI will also be the same people who own the places that replaced you with automation.....meaning these aren't people with your best interest in mind and didn't want to pay people for work so they certainly won't just accept paying people for nothing.Shit is going to get *rough*.I'll spend 20% more someplace else, thanks.

Losing track of it somehow was my personal fucking ongoing nightmare. It's like the feeling of not knowing where your phone is, if your phone could kill people.I've come home from the range, gotten lazy about emptying the range bag and stashing everything, then had a fucking heart attack when I look in the safe the next day and there's an empty spot where a pistol should be. Of course it's still in the range bag, but that two seconds of "holy shit I don't immediately know where my weapon is" will make your butthole loosen.I, myself, would pucker the shit ~~out~~ in to itPinch that Tuttle head right off.I've somewhat had this experience, but I always know it's in the house. I do a triple check before I leave the range to make sure that EVERYTHING is in the bag before I leave. I have definitely accidentally  left it around the house a few times though.Edit: Before anybody freaks out.... There are no children in my house at all. The youngest person in the house is my wife... Who is 22 and owns her own guns too.Spending weeks in the field on an Army training exercise where your weapon never leaves your side it takes a few days to readjust. Simple things like leaning forward and instinctively getting reading to catch it from falling off your shoulder but nothing is there. It's like this heart sinking chill that makes your arms weak and hyper alert to everything around you for a few seconds. Haven't been in the field in over 10 years but still know that feeling.Sounds a bit like leaving the house without a backpack as a kid.I'd be super nervous about that too if I was in the same situation, BUT what are the circumstances that would lead to to leaving your sidearm in the bathroom??"I gotta take a shit, I'm gonna go ahead and have my pistol on the coat hanger hook on the backside of the door."Cop here. You'd be surprised how many cops I know who have done this. Sloppy and lazy officers are my pet peeve (right below racist and aggressive), but you're around that gun so much that it's not as hard as you think. I constantly check myself and I nearly forgot it in my locker once.That's no excuse, it's just not as unthinkable as you'd think. Changing routine will get you too. I used to keep my pistol in the holster on my gunbelt, but when I had a kid I took to out and kept it somewhere more secure. I was used to the gun already being on the belt, and those things are so heavy it's easy to miss. I almost showed up to roll call with an empty holster more than once for a few months.Especially when you wear it all day, every day, it can feel like you always have it on your person, even when you don't. It would be like taking a wedding ring off while doing machining and forgetting to put it back on. Yes, it is bigger and much more dangerous than that wedding ring, but when you are around it all the time it sure doesn't feel like it. The longer you have been around it, the more likely you are to do something similar to this. Like you said, doesn't excuse this, I just understand the error.Honestly probably not far off. Id assume he took his gun off and probably set it on top of the toilet paper dispenser or something so that someone couldn't reach under the stall and grab it from his holster.OH. That's insightful, thanks.Take the whole holster off of the belt and stick it between your legs in your pants. Its a pain, but I think that's what I would recommend  I assume you haven't carried a firearm into a bathroom. Try this, get a toy gun, and a cheap holster that will fit it (or, alternatively, one of those phone cases that attaches to your belt) and try taking a shit. It's neither safe nor comfortable to leave it attached to your clothing, when said clothing is around your ankles. I'm not condoning what the cop did, anyone carrying a weapon should maintain 100% accountability of it at all times, but it's actually fairly common to remove your firearm from the holster (or with the holster, depending on your setup) to use the bathroom.&gt;if your phone could kill people.Implying my mixtape isn’t recorded on my phone. It's been 12 years since I was in Iraq and had a rifle with me everyday, yet a few days every week I still wake up and panic when I don't see it next to me. That panic isn't because I worry about my safety, it's because of how bad the shit storm would have been had I lost my weapon. Although, seemed like it worked out fairly well for this guy...he was getting paid for a year without working until he fucked it up. "Pri-vate CATSWAGGER you don't need to worry about where your Weapon is, **IT'S IN  MY OFFICE!!** NOW GET YOUR ASS UP HERE ON THE DOUBLE!!" Ya, I've never even been in the service and it makes nervous to imagine that coming over the PA system. Ha. They wouldn’t do it like that, not my unit anyway. They would have kept the fact that they had my rifle quiet to see how I dealt with it and to create maximum panic. This is the correct answer. Then, once you're thoroughly sweating bullets, checking every corner, nook and cranny while doubling back on your steps throughout the day, contemplating the amount of shit you're going to be in ....only then would Staff Sergeant come up to you and say "/u/sraperez, you look like you lost something." Then it begins. Interesting. My parents would do the exact same thing if I forgot or misplaced my military i.d. as a kid. Forget to grab it off of the nightstand before heading off for school. Don't remember that you didn't wear it in the morning so by early afternoon when you notice it's not in your pouch around your neck, you start freaking out. Trace your steps from class to class all day, check lost and found, check the office to see if anyone turned it in. The closer it gets to time to get out, the more panicked you get. You pray to God that maybe it's at home and if you just don't take off your jacket when you get there, you can run in to drop off your bag, grab it if it's on the stand and throw it on and act like you had it all day. But instead, you come home and dart into your room and see nothing. Your heart is racing and you're throwing things out of the way praying it fell behind a shelf or something. Do this for 20 minutes, unaware that your mom has been watching from the doorway the entire time...until she steps in and says, "Did you lose something?"At least in that case, it's not a deadly weapon.Just one more reason I could never be a cop.  Hell, I left my passport on an airport counter one time.I mean, you don't have a holster for your 5 pound passport on your hip. That's one heavy ass pistol!Your point still stands, though.&gt; I was private Detective for many years and had to carry a weapon every day. Losing track of it somehow was my personal fucking ongoing nightmare. It's like the feeling of not knowing where your phone is, if your phone could kill people.I can imagine.  I'd have to have a lanyard or something with an alarm.  The military actually used lanyards for a lot of handguns until around WW2.  The original 1911s and similar-era revolvers had lanyard loops at the bottom of the grips.  This was largely a throwback from horseback days and was eventually done away with.&gt;was eventually done away with_Boy, do I have news for you!_Good point.  Wasn't it the new one based on the Sig 320?  Just can't understand why they are bothering these days.If only they made some kind of compartment made just for guns that you could physically attatch to your clothingI would probably want a leather one, it looks good, is durable.  You have a heck of an idea!I keep my pistol on a chain."All employees must wash their handguns in the sink before returning to work"Pretty good advice. Soap in the barrel helps make it all slippery and the bullets go faster.Wouldn't want the bullets to be dirty, some one could get infected.Plus, who doesn't want a nice shiny handungthe dung should never be in the handBut sometimes it is, especially if there is cheapass toilet paper.you gotta do a mummy wrap wipe to increase the ply countThis guy poopsif you're going to do something often, you might as well be good at it How else am I gonna waste time and Reddit at work.So *you're* the guy using up all the Reddit...*Why was there dung in your item box??* -GuildmarmClean bullets mean the people who get shot don't have to worry about lead poisoning. This doesn't sound right but I don't know enough about gun science to dispute it./r/weekendgunnitr/kenm r/shittylifeprotipsI'm in the testing process for multiple departments. It blows my mind that I haven't gotten an offer yet when people like this are trusted to uphold the law.I gave up trying to get in. I constantly scored in the top brackets of test takers yet nothing ever happened after that. It had been my dream for as long as I can remember but I’m 27 now and I’m not getting any younger. I’ve thrown in the towel and it depresses me every day. If it's been your dream for so long, you may need to relocate to get into a different department. Problem is many departments give preferential placement for ex military, regardless of how well they do.I’m also former USAF and still haven’t gotten in. I guess it's not what you know, it's who you know.Like I said, look at higher demand departments in bigger cities. You may have to move, but if it's your dream, it's worth it. My number one goal is fish and wildlife in Washington state, but I'm going for a completely different department to build up a fat LE resume. Maybe I'll transfer, maybe I'll love where I am and stay. But yeah, I had to go for a department in a city I wasn't planning on staying in.   I had a teacher, a father in his mid to late thirties. A third of the way through the year, he packs his things and leaves after being accepted finally. You'll make it, you're not too old, and things like that take time. Good luck!Oh wow, I didn’t expect to read that at all. If what you say is true, maybe me pushing 30 means it isn’t yet too late. 8 years of trying and not getting in is demoralizing as hell though, that’s for damn sure. The average age for  ***DEVGRU*** is almost 40 lolI don't think your age will be much of an issueWell, to be fair this guy probably didn't start out as a SEAL.But still, 30 isn't that old for a new officer. Our academy always has a few people that age. Sometimes folks in their 40s as well.It's really funny when you have a rookie in his 40s and his training officer is in this late 20s. Everyone wants to talk to the older guy not knowing he's only been a cop for two weeks. Another anecdote; my mom's friend who recently turned 40, had a lifelong dream of being a firefighter. He did it about 5 years ago.Pro tip: when they ask what you would do if you pulled over the Chief and he smelled like alcohol: don't answer that you would arrest him and treat him like any other suspect. Yes, every department will ask you this question. It's their way of finding out if you are more ethical than hierarchical. That’s exactly what I’ve said the multiple times I’ve been asked that question. I kept thinking in the back of my mind “there’s no way they want to hear me say I’d treat him any differently, then can’t expect me to answer in a blatantly corrupt manner right out of the gate, right?”Looks like you might be too ethical to be a cop. You might also be too smart. I'd recommend the fire department.Wow, this is so wrong. Police should be held to higher ethical standards than anyone, but they actively try to higher dumber, more compliant officers?... This is utterly fucked yes, they want control, not law enforcement.Just either refuse to answer the question outright, give the corrupt answer (that they want), or say "I would handle the situation as my supervisor instructed" letting them know that'll you'll defer to someone else's judgement to protect the ingrained power structure.... You want to be a cop therefore you should get used to being a dirty cop, or at least pretending...What are you "supposed" to answer?&gt;every department False. I have been through like, four. And got asked that zero times. I was hired and was asked this question. Anyone who said they wouldn’t arrest the Chief was automatically disqualified. Start a private security firm and eventually become a millionaire doing it.&gt; It blows my mind that I haven't gotten an offer yet when people like this are trusted to uphold the law.Maybe you're [too smart?](http://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836)I hope not. It took me nearly 7 years to get close to earning my Associates Degree. Maybe you're too tall and lanky and they prefer fat guys Not dogging you at all cause working towards any level of education at any speed is always positive, but out of curiosity, why has it taken you 7 years to get an associates degree? I started college before I was ready. A combination of ineptitude, immaturity, and procrastination destroyed my chances of attaining a 2 year degree in 2 years. I've dropped out 4 times and pursued several different dead end jobs too.  You got this. You will get that associates degree. Not op, but I got my first assoicates degree quickly but it's taken me over 10 years to get my second one because I keep switching majors. I feel like there's nothing I'm passionate about and everything is too stressful.I hear ya man. I got my bachelors in finance but I hate it. I'm way more interested in blue collar type jobs since I love to move around and work more physically, but it just doesn't pay the bills around where I live. Have you ever thought about going into some kind of field engineering position where you have to go set up systems and climb around in factories? Something like robotic arms or conveyor belt systems. It pays closer to and has the required technical skill of an engineering desk job but gives the hands-on work of a blue collar job. Depending on the job you might even be fine with your finance degree instead of a more technical majorNever thought of this. Thanks for the suggestion! Ay, I'm 45 and just enrolled again to try and get mine. I started when I was 17 and the world was at my door.Good on you for being able to reflect and see where you can improve, they continue to work toward something long-range. I wish you the best! I don't know about him, but I'm getting my Associate's this December and my first credit is from fall 2007. but that's because I quit for about 7 years to join the navy and then have a real job before deciding to go back and actually get a degree.I "started" mine 9 years ago. still haven't gotten it.  took classes, failed classes, and ended up joining the military taking like 1 class a year.u/tallandlanky Take care of the people of your community. Don't be a mindless dickhead. I actually despise cops from the last few years of interacting with them. I know that there must be some good ones out there, but the ones who I interact with say otherwise.This is something that I don't think is stressed enough. Technically a police officer's job is to uphold the law and keep the peace. In reality,  if you cannot build a good rapport with your community, then your effectiveness is nullified.  People should not fear or be wary of you.One of my best friends recently became a police officer after being a sales manager for years. We hardly talk anymore because he's become a self righteous asshole. I knew him when he couldn't even remember where he left his car the night before.I'm not even on the cop hate bandwagon that much of Reddit is but all his new "bros" have changed him. Once someone becomes an officer they pretty much HAVE to follow the blue wall of silence, blue code, blue shield.    [Florida State Trooper Donna "Jane" Watts pulled over and ticketed a Miami Cop for going over 120 MPH in his marked patrol car (he was late to his off duty job.)](http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-jane-watts-lawsuit-hollywood-20160322-story.html)  He broke the law but apparently she fucked up.  She was actually invesitgated by the FHP for pulling him over, because her supervisor told her to back off.  She was cleared of wrong doing.  Over 88 cops in 25 departments illegally searched for her info over 200 times.  Had random cops show up in front of her house, at all times, just sitting there.  Recieved death threats.    It also started a Miami PD vs FHP rivalry.  A Miami cop wanted to get revenge, so he pulled over a FHP trooper for going 90 MPH and said "How does it feel to be pulled over?"... but he fucked up.  First, he was out of his jurisdiction and wasnt allowed to pull him over.  Second, the FHP troopers brother was a Miami PD Internal Affairs investigator. When the Miami PD officer realized this, he begged the FHP trooper not to tell his brother and said "Please. I have 3 kids, Ill buy you dinner"The FHP trooper then called his brother and the Miami PD officer "freaked out" and left the scene before any other cops came.         And    [In 2006, Bernardino County, Calif., Dep.

The article was published over 15 years ago. How did you manage to dig that up and do you think recruiting has changed at all from then? I think you might be flogging a dead horse. It is literally the only that comes up when searching for 'too smart to be a cop'. One case from 20 years ago. The person you replied to will have a really hard time finding a more recent instanceIt's the kind of thing that gets measured on the hiring tests, and doesn't get listed as "smarts." It'll be in a profile of things that indicate how likely someone is to stick with the job. If this idea is true, then one of those measures correlates with average intelligence, with too high of an intelligence counting against you. Perfectly legal if they've done a proper statistical analysis that shows this is the case, because it's related to job performance and retention. Don't you mean wicked smaht?It is crazy. Some ppl just want to do the job, and even if its naively, try make a difference. And yet, you see all these other retards getting onto the force and it doesn't make any sense.Because people usually do stupid stuff after they are hired, not before. It's not like during the interview the person is gonna be like "I like to drive drunk, buy hookers and blow, also I love to harass people." That's how bad employees get through the cracks. I mean if you've ever interviewed somebody for a job, they are only going to kiss your ass. It's extremely hard to tell if somebody is going to be a good employee before they are hired. When i was in management I saw people with phenomenal resumes that were fuck off employees. One of my best employees I didnt want to hire because he was just bad in the interview but I gave him a shot anyway and he was great. Once they're in they're protected. I can't for the life of me understand that. How can an otherwise good cop look the other way while some dumbass disgraces their profession. Where's the pride??It’s not what you know, it’s who you know. He's been on paid administrative leave since September of 2016? 13 months paid leave? He messed up pretty big. What takes that long to resolve in that situation? Probably bureaucratic paperwork. Forms in triplicate, signatures up the gamut, review boards on setting up times for review boards, etc.From this 2011 article:" I complained again to Officer Christopher Challies that Jane Sweeney assaulted me. Patrolman Christopher Challies began following me around Hyannis. Challies was screaming from his car that the “Sweeney’s had a “restraining order” against me. He yelled from his car that I was under arrest. Challies pulled his police cruiser over on Main Street and chased after me on foot. He caught hold of my shoulder and threw me onto the pavement on Main Street. Challies produced severe bruising and lacerations covering the entire front of my person. When I struggled to keep my jogging/sweatpants from being caught in the handcuffs, Officer Challies and Detective Mark Delaney cited me for “Resisting Arrest”. Challis then grabbed the waistband of my sweatpants and pulled them down to my knees. I was completely exposed on Main Street while the officers laughed as I lay facedown on Main Street. The incident occurred in the morning hours, in broad daylight, with many witnesses passing by, and in full view of several store owners."Edit: Forgot to add link address:  http://welcometobarnstable.blogspot.com/2011/12/so-just-how-convoluted-is-corruption.html Whatta guy.He would've gotten away with the DUI if it weren't for our amazing [Hyannis News](https://hyannisnews.com/breaking-why-was-a-barnstable-sergeants-police-business-cards-and-ids-behind-the-wheel-of-a-suspected-drunk-driving-crash-multiple-christopher-challies-hyannis-news-cape-cod/)Media doing it RIGHT!&gt;Challies is a Barnstable police sergeant and 20-year veteranIt makes you wonder what they have overlooked for the past twenty years.Alcoholic.  Who knows if it's recent or what but having seen so many of these folks over the years.  Booze has got to be the worst addiction you can have as far as fucking your life up.  While I am not around many drug addicts I just don't see how it could be worse than booze.  It's so life destroying.  I am not a tee totaling, pearl-clutcher but at the first sign I like that stuff enough to crave it, I won't be touching it again.  Seen so many lives ruined beyond ruined with it. I'm around addicts all the time and booze is the worst because it's insidious.A friend sees you drinking 3 times to a stupor in one week? May be a rough patch. Maybe he's stressed? Anyone sees you with a needle once? He needs help.I can drink myself stupid 4 days a week, and nobody bats an eye. I talk about the couple times I've done mushrooms and people look at me like I'm a horrible person. Nobody is going to get hurt while I'm on shrooms bc I can hardly focus on one thing for more than a minute without tripping out. Shrooming and driving would be impossible. *If I could find my keys*, I'd be in amazement by the way my keys sound when they jingle, and never even make it down to my car. I'd just spend the next hour playing with my keys and looking at the ceiling like a babbling baby, not running grandmas off the road like a drunk.I know plenty of alcoholics who never got dui's, and plenty of non alcoholics who have. Getting a DUI isn't really enough to label someone as an alcoholic. This coming from a sober alcoholicWell I was thinking of the whole leaving the gun in the bathroom and then getting a DUI.  Seems like as a police officer you might have an issue doing both those things but you are right I did make an assumption that is not always indicative of an alcoholic.I’ve lived on cape cod (Barnstable county)for a while. It’s a huge vacation area, but also drugs are really bad there, especially noticeable in the winter months. I got mixed up in bad stuff and needless to say heard a lot about different cops and their misdeeds, drug habits ect. If I found a gun in the bathroom I'd probably keep it.  The serial number would get reported as stolen and you'd get into a lot of trouble if you got caught with it. Assuming it's a Glock, remove all the parts and toss the polymer frame. Now buy an 80% Glock lower and install the stolen parts on it. Enjoy your mostly free pistol! (Don't actually do this).[deleted]so if you take a rifle and disassemble it into parts, one of those parts (the receiver) is going to be the part that is considered the gun still and has the serial number on it. Getting a new frame for a glock would require you to go through all the hoops of getting a fully function pistol because the frame has the serial number and is the gun partNot an 80 percent lower.Seriously? So you can essentily buy a gun, just in parts, with no permits? Of course you can. A gun is just steel, aluminum, polymer, or some other material that has been shaped the right way.http://thechive.com/2012/12/06/apparently-you-can-make-an-ak-47-out-of-just-about-anything-25-photos/Yes you can build one, what I mean is that you can basically buy it like a Lego set. As long as it isn't prebuilt, you can easily make one for yourself without a permit (still not legal, but incredibly easy). AR lower receivers are considered the 'firearm' under law.All the other parts are just chunks of metal. &gt;(still not legal, but incredibly easy). Federally, you can build a gun for personal use from parts (ie your not selling them), however you still need a lower receiver. https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/does-individual-need-license-make-firearm-personal-useYou can buy an '80%' lower receiver, which is a chunk of metal and not a firearm, but requires a few more machining processes to function. Isn't the serial number also stamped on the slide?This guy r/glocks. You know, I have a good chuckle at the "free gun" jokes, but...I'd probably call someone if I found a loose gun. You just don't know if it was used to blow some dude's brains out and then dumped. I wonder if, somewhere, there exists a cop who lost his service weapon, then bought a Glock from a store and put it in his holster and got away with it.Almost certainly Do not soak the grape concentrate in water for up to a week...LPT: don't get caughtPersonally if I knew it was a cop's who forgot it somewhere stupid I'd just disassemble and then throw it in a body of water. Fuck that irresponsible prick.A worse person would remove the firing pin, then reassemble it and put it back. Your method would at least be teaching a lesson they could learn from.That’s a horrific thought.I spent 6 years in the army infantry. The idea of forgetting my weapon somewhere and having someone tamper with the firing pin terrified me... also the idea of just forgetting my weapon anywhere terrified me. My first line supervisor would have crucified meI think that’s a rather healthy fear. Good habit not to let your primary defensive tool out of sight.You'd be saving an innocent pupper somewhere."To Forget and Swerve." Err... Uhh... I mean, protect and serve?20 year veteran of the force, I guarantee you he still retires with full pension.He should be fired, but I would disagree with taking away a pension. He's been contributing to that for 20 years, and his employer has been, too. If someone were fired from any other job, would you be shocked and appalled that they get to keep their 401k?A drunken cop driving around when he also left his gun in the damn sink. I think this guy deserves at least some fucking punishment.Same as every other position - get written up / put on a performance improvement plan / fired for the gun in the sink, take the criminal penalties for getting a DUI.I don't see why people are bringing the pension into this. He already paid for it with 20 years of contributions.Of course he does. He should probably be fired. He should go to jail, but he shouldn't lose his pension.Jeez some people love to really bring on the pain!His pension belongs to him.  He has paid into it and is entitled to it.You mean like the actual sentence prescribed by law for DWI?Sooo Farva?Came here to say that. He was probably driving to get a liter of cola. Seriously how the fuck do you forget your gun in the bathroom. Hell, I double check to make sure I have my phone before I leave the shitter. He was probably drunkIsn't it illegal to be carrying while drunk?Yes. It is typically the same BAC limit as driving, though the exact number can vary state to state. The gun is heavy and unwieldy hanging on the belt when you're dropping trou, so they unclip the holster and set it on the toilet tank, then forget to put it back when they're done. After the FBI had a few incidents like this they started training their agents to put the holster in the crotch of their pants so it was impossible to forget it.Losing a service weapon is no joke.  In the military, if you lose a weapon out of negligence, you are more than likely going to get kicked out of the service.Chief Wiggum? It's weird how in our society, that cops are given leniency. They should absolutely be given a harsher sentence than the public.Give them harsher (mainly, longer sentences, or higher fines, as they are supposed to be upholding these laws).Thats what im saying. When the older brother fucks up, he always gets a worse punishment than the younger brother.&gt;Sandwich townNo one else gonna mention it?I live here and was hoping no one would.I grew up in Mashpee, I wonder which restaurant he left the gun in? it just said it was somewhere in BourneThe police cars say Sandwich Police on the side and it makes me laugh every time.

They may not want to tell the media the whole story and of course that will be viewed as police covering for one of their own.So youre saying police dont cover for their own to a heinous level in general? If thats not what youre saying, and we admit its a problem, why wouldnt the media talk about it? Also who said his career was 20 years of success? I havent seen that reported. I went to a police benefit as a date, of the daughter of a cop that I haven't talked to in years.Everyone I talked to was drinking, and drove home.reminds me of the cop from that episode of louieNext week: "MA police officer on paid leave for 6 months before being transferred and promoted to a position in Connecticut."Some people just don't have their shit together... but why we hire these people for important jobs, I'll never understand. Like, nobody cares if your life is in chaos if you work at subway, in fact, it's ok with me, if you're having a hard time with life, get a job like subway.... I don't remind if you forget I said pickles.Please don't become a cop, or a paramedic, or a fireman, or structural engineer, if you can't keep your shit together... and if you get the job when you have your ducks in a row but it all comes crashing down- grow a spine and get help!A cop left his gun in the public bathroom of the gas station I used to work at. Luckily my coworker found it before the middle School around the corner let out and the store filled with kids.What was done with the gun?They sold it to a middle schooler. Didn't you read the comment?He came back for it. We were right across the street from the station and he was back within the hour. I think the most smartass thing I've ever done is request to see the badge and ID of a visibly embarrassed cop in full uniform before I'd give him back his gun. &gt;  I think the most smartass thing I've ever done is request to see the badge and ID of a visibly embarrassed cop in full uniform before I'd give him back his gun.I love this. I bet this contributed to his never forgetting his gun again. Awesome!
He makes a good point.No moral objections here.I have a problem with the qualifier "almost."  Other than that, godspeed. [deleted]I am not commenting on the validity of the article or his thoughts.German Nazis were citizens/military personnel of a signing country of the Geneva convention which would require an agreed upon judicial body/court to pass sentence. As ISIS is not a member of this convention, members of this group are not necessarily afforded the right to trial.  If they are captured and are citizens of the UK, it becomes dependent on UK law to say whether or not they have retained the rights as a British citizen. This would be of concern considering they have renounced all rights by pledging loyalty to another entity. Also he didn't say just capture and execute, he seemed to be alluding to the idea that killing them would end things (it won't.)[deleted]Good questions to ask. However it seems like you are more focused on the idea that the minister is advocating for unprovoked killings. The individuals who betray the UK and are actively engaging in hostilities or supporting the activities of hostiles are terrorists. Clearly due process is necessary but execution after due process seems to be a solution the minister advocates for. I accept I could be wrong here all subject to interpretation. Coalition forces are not killing at will so I don't think your questions are terribly related despite being very well intentioned. Some examples:In the unlikely case that these ISIS soldiers are captured(more likely to be KIA), I sincerely doubt that the very progressive government of the UK would approve a summary execution without Are you going to stop and ask if the kid was 17 or 18 when they are shooting at you? You're not wrong but given the context it doesn't line up. Yeah, those who were captured. But a lot of Nazi's were openly outright killed like the rabid dogs they were.Not the ones on the battlefield Only if they were captured first. Let me make this clear, as a kid I made mistakes, I did some things I'm not proud of. I never joined a fucking terrorist group that proudly kills people who don't join their religion. Sorry, but I don't have sympathy for those that do and get killed. "they're a kid" is not an excuse, as soon as I knew what terrorists were, I knew it was morally wrong to join a terrorist group. Joining a terrorist group is not a mistake, its an action, one that has consequences.Suits me just fine, I think we should do the same with the lot of them.Did ISIS take prisoners? Sex slaves maybe, but not prisoners. So why extend them the courtesy? They're not a legitimate state. And if you let these people go, they'll only carry on their merry way, spreading the word of jihad until they kill others and themselves in some attack.Let's skip all that.I thought the prisoner-taking was supposed to be more of a strategic thing than a courtesy thingBoth.  The idea that if you kill someone elses prisoners means they will kill yours too.  its why prisoner exchanges are done.  However, I would hopw we have surpassed a barbarians humanity... but alas... i have noticed many barbarians in this sub.Sex slaves you say?

What a sneaky way to phrase an argument. Now it’s not Toyota-Mazda’s anti-union stance, the fault shifted to the state of Illinois. How dare those workers attempt to acquire a livable wage and health care by banding together.The only "person" free to choose their associations is the company.&gt; How dare those workers attempt to acquire a livable wage and health care by banding together.Not sure what you mean here.  The pay and benefits at most auto manufacturing, and Toyota in particular are incredible.  Well above industry standards.Are you under the impression that they are not?The reason they are good is because unions have been involved in the automotive industry nearly since its inception.  Without the union fighting to improve wages and benefits in that industry, it would just be another minimum wage factory job.I get that Unions used to be useful, but were pretty much replaced by OSHA and competition.    I can speak to Honda directly, I'm sure Toyota is around the same.  The pay and benefits were well and above and beyond the vast majority of the jobs in their areas.  They have no Union.    Also, I'm okay if someone wants to join a Union.  It's a free market, they have a service you want, go ahead and give them a percentage of your pay.   Shouldn't be forced.The national average Assembly Line Worker salary is $27,800 per year.Want to guess which states lower the average?What does a national average have to do with Toyota?Now try it with AUTO MANUFACTURING. assembly jobs and notice how your argument is invalid.  Actually there both free to choose their associations. The company however has no obligation to hire anyone Eh, automotive assembly plants aren't hiring people for minimum wage even without unions. $20+ an hour with good benefits is a pretty typical entry level salary at Toyota plants, and much of the plant will be much better paid engineers and technicians. These are massively expensive products and improper assembly is a massive cost in regards to brand hits regarding reliability and in potential recalls, they're interested in hiring qualified people and they do that with their compensation. It's pretty sad they people thing 20 an hour is good. My dad made that when he started building airplanes in 1966. So blame union while people take home less and less real money with fewer and fewer rights.Your dad was making the equivalent of $300,000 a year in an entry level factory job?No kidding.  Wages have been stagnent for decades at this point.  So while the cost of living continues to rise, corporations still spout their bullshit line that 20/hour is a "great" starting wage.  Maybe 30 years ago it was.Unions can be bad too you know.Workers in auto plants make well over a living wage without a union. Illinois fucked their own citizens here.People say this, but the plants making auto parts around here max out for most workers at 14 an hour. Most make around 10, the only way any of these people are making a livable wage is if they're working shittons of overtime. A lot of the people there aren't capable of getting benefits because they're just temps.Sure, if you get into THE name brand car plants you'll make more (*because it has the union*) but the people making the parts they put in the cars aren't getting paid shit because if they fight for union representation they start getting threatened with Mexico.And yet this article is about a Toyota-Mazda plant making electric vehicles. A plant that would pay well above a living wage without a union.Yeah, you're saying that, but with what proof?Why are they afraid of their workers being unionized if they were already planning on not exploiting their workers?&gt;Yeah, you're saying that, but with what proof?Probably with the same proof you're laying down claiming that they'd definitely not earn a living wage.Because it is public knowledge what Toyota and Mazda pay their workforce. Wtf are you talking about?Unionization isn't just about pay, firstly, and that can always change. Lmao. Ok dude, get proven wrong so just change the subject. Is that what you're trying to do, or are you really so unfamiliar with what Unions are you honestly think they're just about pay?what?https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Toyota-North-America-Assembly-Line-Worker-Hourly-Pay-E3544_D_KO21,41.htmFrom Payscale.com:the quick answer is the assembly line workers in the US at Ford, Chrysler and GM earn about $27/hour in base pay, while US workers for Toyota earn about $25. When profit sharing bonuses are included, Toyota has actually been paying more to US workers than the Big 3.Indiana here. We have "right to work" and Toyota. I have known very few people that actually work for Toyota directly and when they do they generally do not not last. Very strict everything. Instead they use a hiring company as mentioned above, even for maintenance I believe. Also, Toyota just assembles while everything else is made by another company. I started out at a Ford supplier where everyone made maybe 50 cents over minimum wage. Union or not, most auto jobs are crap accept at the top. Honestly, I do not see why Toyota has an issue with unions if they already pay a competitive wage. Who would want to pay union dues if you were already treated fairly? I suspect it is more about job security and their lack of wanting to offer it. hahahahaha, no, not really.Do some research on how much Toyota pays there line workers, and the benefits, 401k, and profit sharing, then hahahaha some moreThis is how rich people want it to be framed. They're waging a long war against labor and winning big.Because Americans are more concerned with pulling each other down into the boiling water than helping each other out. This is a condition in our society that was created by rich people, and has been nurtured by rich people since the end of WWII. We're pitted against one another in all aspects of our lives; everything is a competition. This keeps otherwise intelligent people completely enslaved; add in the debt slavery trap that the last 2 generations have fallen into, and we're completely under control. It even affects people who we would consider "wealthy". They mortgage themselves up to their eyeballs because they have to keep up with the neighbors or be outcasts. You don't see the overlord class doing shit like that, because they don't have to. They just run Mercedes-Benz and Fidelity ads during televised golf tournaments and keep those new money suckers on the plantation.Race to the bottom, boys!If the UAW wasn't a corrupt backwards organization maybe auto makers would deal with then.Right, it's the Union that's corrupt and not the people who want to exploit the workers. How dare the Union stand in their way. That's so fucked up, right?Do you know anything about the UAW or just the knee jerk KORPORASHUN BAD YOUNYUN GOOD spam so prevalent here. Do you know anything about toyota?  They treat their employees pretty well.Tales I have heard, be it all second hand. One minute late, work all day on vacation time. Forced monitored calisthenics for the first 6 months. Work on a team, one member messes up all punished..up to termination. Terminated for standing in doorway to outside with safety glasses on forehead. Terminated for late twice in a month, once for a tractor trailer accident and once for snow. I'm not sure that's the while story for some of that. Either way there is a reason Toyota got to the point they did and the US auto makers didn't. Late workers and unsafe workers have a huge impact in a lean operation. Having to keep them around due to union regs even more.I'm sure not many generally tell the truth about how they lost their job. Current coworkers though and have yet to suspect other reasons.Assume 15 an gout for line worker is 'good'.also, Toyota only owns 5%. This is mostly Mazda.It’s actually 25.00/hr to start plus incentives that push it over 30.00/hr. Pretty great for relatively unskilled labor. https://www.aerotek.com/jobs/job/US/Princeton-IN/Other/Full-Time-Production-Team-Member/J3S2KC67HWXTJWX25XPNot saying that might not be eventual numbers, but not to start.Yeah when you don't have any real skills it is.&gt; Right, it's the Union that's corruptI generally support unions but the UAW needs a serious reality check.UAW isn't the same as it was 20 years ago.Yeah, the thing I have seen Toyota workers and they are treated fairly.  This is partly due to the culture and partially due to Toyota not wanting to deal with the UAW, which have a colored past and tend to just big down the industry.Of course. Why would they want to pay their employees a livable wage?  "Right-to-work [your entire life away]" is accurate.  You'll need two full-time jobs to make ends meet. Honda doesn't have unions - they pay starting at $16/hour and top out at $27/hour after 8 years. In rural Ohio. That's like 90k in a big citylol, no it isn't. I live near a big city and my home is cheaper then equiv. homes in MarysvilleIt is in Urbana, Bellefontaine, Springfield, East Liberty and the surrounding cities. People are driving from Columbus and Dayton and Sidney and Lima to work there. Clearly it doesn't pay enough. Which cities are you talking about? so... shit then?Homes in Raymond go for 200k+At least here in Kentucky, getting a job at Toyota is a good paying job. So to my eyes it looks like unions killing jobs again. I’m in a Union myself, but about the only thing that is good is my health insurance. The fact they are against merit pay rubs me the wrong way, and I definitely only make what I’m worth when I work a ton of OT(which I don’t particularly want to most of the time).Good job for a non-temp. I also am starting to believe their beef is more with the supporting businesses. From brakes to headlights, the parts companies don't charge as much in a non-union setting.Then quit the union and join a place that's nonunion? Easier said than done when "union shops" are allowed. But if someone wants to be employed but doesn't want to join the union, shouldn't that be allowed?Should that person be able to be covered by the union's contract without being in the union?Up to the employerWhy should it be up to the employer to determine if someone who isn't part of the collective be covered by the collective agreement?Because they’re the one hiring the personRight so that person should have to negotiate their own contract, no?If the owner is fine with copying and pasting the Union contract that’s fine or they could negotiate their own, again up to the employer Right but the crux of the issue in right to work states is that the union MUST negotiate on behalf of, and represent in disputes, all employees. These are things that cost money, why should someone get a free ride?How does it cost the union more to represent all? If anything it strengthens their position. They just don’t get those union dues to put in the pockets of politicians because the person works for the company,  not the union. OOC, are you interested in discussing the larger issue with "free riders" or is it only relevant when you at looking to defend the union? OOC, are you interested in discussing the larger issue with "free riders" or is it only relevant when you at looking to defend the union? Do you honestly believe the company has the employees best interest in mind?  And that's their motivation to choose a 'right-to-work' state?  If someone benefits, in the form of increased wages, better benefits, and protection from unfair management practices?  Due to the bargaining of a union, then yes, I think they should pay into the union. Would you pay 10 to 50 dollars a month to earn $30 an hour instead of $15 an hour? Well now they are getting $0 an hour so...But they have their pride, and that will pay the bills.You are right, they should all get 1 penny an hour and thank the gods.Toyota has a pretty good track record of paying a good living wage so... yeah a lot of people lost a good opportunity here.You make it sound like the workers are forced to take the job or if they are too stupid to do otherwise.That’s the great thing about capitalism. All transactions are mutually beneficial; otherwise they wouldn’t happen. If one party doesn’t want the product/job/service they just walk away!That's a very romantic idea. But the reality is that many people are forced to take crumby jobs, due to a lack of better alternatives.  And it's my opinion that unions have played a major role in improving the lives of millions of Americans by negotiating fair wages, benefits, and safer working conditions.  That’s a romantic idea. They actually haven’t though they were never a highly significant part of the workforce and mainly were used to keep blacks out of jobs. The only people benefiting from unions are the people at the top and the politicians getting donations from them. Sounds like your unions need some repairing.&gt;they were never a highly significant part of the workforce What the fuck are you talking about? At the peak in the early 60s [nearly 1 in 3 workers were unionized](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/23/385843576/50-years-of-shrinking-union-membership-in-one-map)Funny most folks I know in unions make a good bit more than nonunion folks I know. I call that a benefit.&gt; That’s the great thing about capitalism. All transactions are mutually beneficial; otherwise they wouldn’t happen. If one party doesn’t want the product/job/service they just walk away!In theory, yes. But in practice, corporations have much more bargaining power than individuals and they can easily afford to pit people against each other for the corporation's benefit. This is happening in the US right now; it's why the middle class is shrinking and the economy is floundering in spite of productivity skyrocketing.They are forced to take the job when it's the only one in town and they have no protections.Apply that to Americas stupid take on work ethic and you have people busting their ass for shit jobs and thanking management for the privileged.So before these factories come these people who have “no other choice” are doing what exactly? They are just waiting around doing nothing?If they don’t want the job they can continue doing what they have been doing, they can start a small business, they can move to another town, they can raise cows or have a garden, the list goes on and on.They aren’t forced to do crap. You clearly have  no sense of making ends meet and it’s probably due to you viewing a strong work ethic as “stupid.” It’s sad that clods such as you have these defeatist/dependent mindsets that crash and burn so hard when there is any sort of crisis.“What are they going to do if there’s no protections?!” Hahaha, what a loser. $100 you grew up in an upper middle to high class home (probably outside a metropolitan area,) got trophies for trying, and had everything else handed to you to.But you don't have any problem at all with redistribution of wealth. Why does a minor free rider problem bother you here? I mean that's your political raison d'etre, correct? To find ways to create free riders?Freedom of association is on the other hand a massive concern. I can't see that you have any principled concern here, in fact the opposite is true.Perhaps your point of view would change diametrically if unions were suddenly reliably funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to Republicans?Yeah, I don't care about anything you just mentioned. I just care about people being paid an honest, livable wage. The truth is, unions built the middle class. Not democrats. Not republicans. Just regular people banding together to bargain for a better existence.Truth? Or do you mean propaganda?No, becasue historically management applies pressure to Union people to get the majority to opt out, and then drives down wages and benefits and drive up hours worked.The few factories left actually do have living wages though. Normally start at 13ish and you can make near 20 an hour after a couple years.   Kind of a shame, with all of the businesses that have been fleeing IL it would have been a boon to the stateThe state should be shovel ready sites.Oh wait, a pro auto management rag said it was unions, so that's it.Also, manufacturing in Illinois started because was smart location logistically. The changes in transportation of the last 100 years as removed that logistics advantage.Same thing with Detroit.What is the deal on right-to-work states anyway?    Are there really places that, in order to get a job, you have to give part of your salary to a Union?Sure, closed shops.  If you want to work at one, you need to join the union.Do any of their cars already share a platform, or is this just for the new electric car cooperation?
They're...uh...upside down.Middle Ages/Inquisitorial torture and Pittura infamante *far* more-so than lynching.You're not wrong. But lynching was torture. So... a torture involving people hung reminds people of another torture involving people hung.So... yeah. It obviously wasn't meant to be offensive. I can see how people might not find it cool.Lynching is more on the murder side.Torturous murder.You are the first of twenty people to actually talk to me about this, though.So thanks.No problem."Anytime I see a rope around a branch of a tree it only leads me to think about one thing".

(KMPH) -- A homeowner in Hanfo**R**d says she took down her H**A**lloween de**C**orations after Hanford Pol**I**ce told her they were "racially offen**S**ive."The black body bags hanging from the ho**M**e caused many to question whether or not the Halloween decorations took things too far. Hanford Police told the homeowner that several people had complained to the NAACP about the trash bags she used to hold the "dead bodies" in.I found another one.Yeah that says something more about *you* (Not you-you, as in her) than anything else.If I saw the remnants of a rope tied to a tree, the first thing I'd think is a swinging rope, or a swing, or a tire swing. Is nothing sacred to these leftists? First the War on Christmas, now they're starting a War on Halloween, too?!War on Christmas. Lul.We laughed, and then came the War on Halloween...Ya I dunno about this. I've seen people stuff dark colored jump suits and do the same thing and no one thought it was racial. DamnI know Halloween can be scary.Why can't people mind their own business? If you find it offensive, ok. I could perhaps see how someone might get there. Maybe. So what? Stay away from that person. Don't buy stuff from his business. Don't let your kids play with his kids. Why are the police even involved? All because someone's feelings got hurt... Or you know *giggles* look the other way. So much this.She had a choice. Once it was expressed to her that she was inadvertently making people uncomfortable, she chose to remove the thing that was causing offense. Some people are just polite. Crazy, I know. What's impolite is screaming that everything offends you and you need people to coddle you're hurt wittle fee fees No one was screaming. Once it was pointed out to the homeowner that the decorations could be taken in a different manner than they intended, they took them down on their own. Yes when police are on your lawn with lights flashing and the neighbors are staring there's no pressure. People wouldn't feel any pressure in that situation at all. If they were actually lynched, and looked like people of color (not trash bags of color), this would make total sense. People love to make mountains out of mole hills.The NAACP needs to learn how to pick its battles.  And they also need to go back and read "the boy who cried wolf" and see if they can learn something. They'll probably find something racist in that book too...Most wolves are part black. Don't cry black.That ship sailed a long time ago.Dr. Reese needs to take his victim complex and play in fucking traffic. He's been weird since his wife left him. He's still trying to pick up the pieces.How is this not protected by our first amendment rights? Oh it is? Fuck. The first amendment guarantees that you can speak out against the US government without fear of reprisal. It doesn't give you carte blanche to say or do whatever you like without consequence. So no, this has absolutely nothing to do with the first amendment.It does when it involves the police. The police are part of government. They can't get involved unless there's as a safety issue. HOAs, private lawyers sure. But you can hang a confederate flag on your lawn and cut your grass in a Nazi uniform and government can't do shit to you. Can someone explain to me why Home Ow ers Associations have any power and who gives it to them?You must sign a contract giving them certain abilities.  Part of that contract is going to say that you must have any purchaser of your home also sign it otherwise you can not sell it.  It becomes a condition of owning the property.  So in essence, you give the power to them.  I have seen HOAs that are extremely over the top mandating which day of the week you must mow your yard, not allowing a car to be in the driveway, not allowing you to change your own engine oil, your house must be one of 3 colors, can only have x number of plants, and so on.  I offered on a house that was in an HOA that only said things along the lines of the size of the house must be above 1600 sqft, must a one story, no fence in front yard over x ft tall, no farm animals, and a few other small items that most people would never need to care about.  Basically they wanted to keep a minimum property value as to not have a trailer house moving in screwing over their neighbors value.  So mostly covering construction as the HOA was made prior to all lots being built.  No one cared what color your front door was and exactly the kind of mailbox you had.  So the HOA can sue her or her neighbors can but cops forcing you to take it down seems like a constitutional violation. Dark Souls 3 undead settlement.  Intense halloween display, but nothing racist about it. People need to relax and mind their own business.Get a fucking grip already.  Jesus, when did people become so thin skinned?When regressive cunts like Anita Sarkeesian were given a platform by the Left and allowed to screech about how everything is racist and sexist And so another self-absorbed snowflake makes everything about "me me me" and gets triggered and someone panders to their nonsense as usual so next time they'll push it even further. People need to start pushing back more against these PC controlling thought police. It went past full retard a long time ago.I wish I could be a perpetual victim It would be amazing, just blame all your shortcomings on ”wypipo” Aaah must feel so good. Become trans-abled.This PC bullshit is why Trump won, you knowWell, that and the same people who would have been doing the lynching 50 years ago.The 1920's were the last that 'legal' lynching took place. The last lynching in the US was in 1980 but it was a murder and not apart of the sanctioned lynching that took place in the 20's. I'm sure the people getting lynched from 1930-1980 found that very comforting.Sure but when you say 50 years, you're way off. No one alive today has never known a slave. The grandparents of today never knew a slave. That time was a world away from us. Human trafficking is so widespread that even if you live in the US you have probably seen someone in indentured bondage.The grandparents of today still experienced segregation and extrajudicial killing of black people. That time is not as far away as it may seem.The fact that this comment is in the negative speaks volumes about the people who come into these threads. So what it it? Are we all Russian agents, rampant bots, or trump voting kicks who thirst for black blood? &gt;No one alive today has never known a slave.Modern slavery is a massive global problem - it's happening in every country. Its happening in the UAE, but they are arabs and muslims so lets not bring that up. 😉It's happening in the US right now. It's just not very visible.Care to give me an example of ongoing slavery in the US?[removed]Forced prostitution, shipping in people from other countries and telling them they owe you ridiculous money, paying Pennies on the dollar for illegals to work, the same for prisoners (and people profit from this), etc to name a few.I mean it's not slavery in the black and white we see in the history books but by all rights is it human slavery.Edit: I, too, downvote people when I don't agree with them. /sI think one who goes to happy ending massage parlors has met a slave or two. So?  And I mean that seriously. Why on Earth does that matter?Have you forgotten the racism of Democrats, you know, the ones responsible for things like Jim crow. Your narrative is crumbling.Oh look, it's this overly simplistic crap again.It says something when all you have against dems is from over half a century ago.My side isn't the one crying about "systematic oppression" and racism. It seems awfully convenient to ignore those who put such things into action. Blacks were a lot better off as Republicans, look at the state of their community now. So either you believe systematic oppression is real= Democrats are to blame or it isn't in which case people are blowing smoke out of their ass to push bigotry against the right. I'm am fairly centered, I don't think it's crazy to accurately represent the facts which you seem to be ignoring. You do realize that back in the 1800s and up until about the 1930s or so that republicans were seen as the liberal party and democrats were conservatives. The dems wanted everything to stay the same while the repubs pushed for labor laws, unions, and progressive change. Things started changing around the time of FDR who was the first "liberal" democrat. The republicans then became more and more conservative, saying business was good so unions needed to calm down, going through McCarthyism and the Red Scare eventually culminating in the 1970s-80s with its political ties to the religious groups. I mean, Hillary did call Black men “super predators”. One party is trying to make things better than the past and the other uses the term "progressive" as a pejorative. Giving preferential treatment to certain races and genres while claiming others are racist or sexist...I'd say the pejorative use of "progressive" is the perfect amount of irony. Also becuase all his voters are racists. That tooA lot of anti-trump people are racist towards white people. Just saying...Yeah everyone forgets about when black people kidnapped and enslaved white Europeans or when all the Jews committed genocide.My family/lineage had no hand in any of it, yet people are still allowed to disparage me for the color of my skin? I don't think so. There is no excuse for racism by anyone, against anyone.Anyone who is racist is an asshole.  But us white people have a very particular type of racism that is trying to stick it's ugly head out after hiding for about 40 years.“Us white people” don’t have any more of a particular type of racism than any other race. That’s a retarded statement by the way. What if I said “you black people have a particular type of crime you like to commit” it would just be retarded and racist. I'm not black.  I'm white, so all I can talk about what we as white people can do to make the world a better place because I have the perspective of walking around as one every day.  If we want other groups of people to start taking account for and denouncing bad apples of their group, we should be volunteering to do the same.Respectfully, I don't think there's an "us white people", but I do agree there's a notable difference between Dixie racism and the sort that's surged up in some minority populations/the far left lately. Dixie racism is undoubtedly more violent, but I maintain that I shouldn't be targeted because there are some dill weed practitioners who share a skin color, you know? It's the same thing that people of color have dealt with for a long time. Bad apple theory. We as a society should avoid falling into that particular trap.I agree.  We need to learn how to get along.  One way is to stop offending people.  Even if you didn't intend to be offensive.  That includes these hanging bodies, and that also includes kneeling for national anthems.  I'm not saying law enforcement needs to be involved but let's learn how not to offend our brothers and sisters we share the world with.&gt; black people kidnapped and enslaved white EuropeansYou know this actually happened?  There was raids on Southern Europe from African slavers.You consider Arabs black?Not all were Arab.  There is/was intermixing of races in North Africa.So when white slavery was abolished, what did they do to oppress and intimidate white people that is currently being done in USA?Kidnapped? Africans were trading off their own kind. And I boycott the companies that currently support slavery in Africa.  That doesn't mean we can't do something about the racism in our own country that's currently happening and is echoing periods in our own history.Everyone does casually leave out who sold the slaves to the europeans in the first place. And the descendants of the victims still have to deal with dog whistle shit that white people are doing today, and the fact that there are racists and evil people of all races has nothing to do with us as a society trying to do something about it.You forget the Atlantic slave trade would never have existed if coastal African tribes didn't enslave their enemies and sell themWhy not just go ahead and ban Halloween already? These people seem to be doing everything they can to make it suck ass anyway.replace bags with skulls and everybody will be ok.Are you saying black people don't have skulls?Interestingly enough, a house in my neighborhood has several "bodies" hanging just like that from their tree, but they're wrapped in white sheets. Nobody's ever said a word.Again this is why Trump won, and most likely will win again, thanks snowflakes, 🖕🏻.Would it have been ok if the trash bags were white?We are all the same color once you get past the first layer. That depends on how long that first layer has been gone.I mean, we all decompose the same. There is a whole science behind that. Hell, even if we all looked exactly the same, people would just find another way to discriminate against each other. You aren't one of those lowdown Pessimists, are you? Optimists, get him/her/them!There are actual biological difference between races. You can even infer the race of a person from their bones or teeth, it's not a perfect determination, but it's pretty reliable.We should acknowledge that people are different, even if the differences are minor, but that those differences don't make anyone more or less important as a person.What importance is there in acknowledging genetic differences in this context? The point /u/Klaxun was making is that we are all *human,* which you must've gathered...When you are talking about genetics you can not call us all human.  I personally am not 100% human.  I am a human neanderthal hybrid.  That is what white people are.  Some africans may be pure humans still with no neanderthal dna.  Blacks in the USA are gaining some of that dna as generations go along, become less pure human.  In the context of "Getting past the first layer" it is important.  We are not born equal.  There are detectible differences that can give one an advantage of the other in certain aspects.  After the fist layer you can still tell who is what.  Look at the side view of a handful of black people vs white people.  You will see a large difference in the bone structure.  I'm not disputing that there are anthropological and genetic differences in modern humans. My question is *why* does that even matter here? Are you implying that these differences make some people better than others? We are all the same *color* once you get past the first layer.So meaningful. She could have used the white bags, but they smell like Vanilla or some fruity shit and I'm sorry, bodies hanging from trees in bags just aren't scary if they smell like flowers.I would've kept the bags up and told the officers that the NAACP is welcomed to come by and ask my about it instead of sending henchmen to do it. I have 2 scarecrows hanging on my trees right now. &gt; Anytime I see a rope around a branch of a tree it only leads me to think about one thing.  Man she sure would have hated my grandfather.  He always had a rope around a big tree branch.  He used it to hang dirty black things.  Engines.  He would buy broken down vehicles dirt cheap at auctions, repair them, and sell them at decent profit.  He did much of this work under and old tree because it was in the perfect spot and large branch that came off was good for supporting heavy objects.  He was also totally racist, but the rope and branch had absolutely no meaning.  I personally had a rope hanging from a tree branch. I used it for my daughters swing.  Obviously I wanted to swing my 12 month old from a tree branch to offend people.  Every tv show I have ever seen shows the body bags as black.  If were to use a trash bag to cover a body I would also use the black ones as those seems to be the stronger bags and it is harder to see through them.  People are just getting out of hand.  Your over the top judgement of other people offends me.  IMO: racially offensive, no; poor taste, yes.by this logic bats are racistCompletely agree with the police and complaintants: the first thought I had seeing the photo was "lynching." Not "Halloween" or "scary."And I'm a white Canadian.EDIT: If you don't understand me, I'm going to assume you are too young and/or too ignorant to understand the *image* of lynching. Because this pic? It's exactly what lynching looks like.&gt;EDIT: If you don't understand me, I'm going to assume you are too young and/or too ignorant to understand the image of lynching. Says someone who clearly doesn't know what the image of lynching is.Except this is not lynching. Racist projection must be hard to live with. Is it the color of the garbage bag you find so offensive? Would you be alright with orange garbage bags?It's human figures hung from a tree. Strange fruit. Lynching.Or it could be Halloween. No one cares what you think racistNo, it's not. People are lynched from the neck and not wrapped in plastic and displayed like decorations during a holiday that celebrates the macabre. The only thing this has in common with photos of actual lynching is the rope and tree. Perhaps your Canadian senses are unable to distinguish between sometimes hazy black and white photos [like these]( http://www.gettyimages.com/photos/lynching) (**warning! Link has actual lynching photos**) and this case. They would burn the victims too?  Barbaric.You have no idea what lynching looks like. You have never seen a lynch in your life outside of photos or videos. You have 0 experience in seeing an actual lynch happen. And you have never contributed in stopping a lynch because there has never been one near you. It doesn't surprise me your Canadian.Except for the whole hanging by the neck thing.&gt; Because this pic? It's exactly what lynching looks like.I just did a Google Image search and it is completely opposite of what lynching looks like.https://www.google.com/search?q=lynching&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=ischAll that means is you're a leaf who's out of touch with reality and sees racism everywhere. Pains me to say it, but as another white foreigner (from somewhere that doesn’t celebrate Halloween, or have a lynching history) I completely agree As a non American, if my neighbor would have hung "human bodies" in whatever colored bags in that way from his tree ... I don't care that it was for Halloween, that's not scary that's tasteless.Do such things in your house as bloody, scary and cruel and nerve wrecking as you wish and for your front yard use stuff that has at least some humorous aspect to it. I mean there is a reason why horror movies and horror games have an age restriction. The street should stay child friendly and acceptable for people who do not want to take part in Halloween.Shouldn't that be common sense besides there being also the "hung from a tree history"?It's not racially offensive, it's just offensive. Halloween does not celebrate violent death. If it bothers me as an adult, I would hate to think of how that would affect a much younger kid.Grow up.Snowflakes never grow up. They just melt down 
That'll make them love the Chinese government more. /sI wonder what the government would do if they started kneeling during the anthem.Probably run tanks over them.Don't give conservatives any ideas.Who talks like that?Who's in favor of [leniency for running over protestors](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/18/us/legislation-protects-drivers-injure-protesters/index.html)? Or who just [gets a kick](http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article174568231.html) out of the idea of killing protestors? So far this stuff is all talk and no action, but damn, a lot of people talk like that. Someone making a joke based on current events, lighten the fuck up. People who are politically awareI know you're joking, but the government isn't looking for love. It just wants their obedience. It's like how most people in North Korea know things are horribly wrong in some way, but they also know that to keep living they need to show their total commitment to the most insane pronouncements. It's nowhere near that bad in China, but the reasoning is the same. Disagree in private, go along in public.If the law does become retroactive, that guy holding the sign in the photo will probably shit his pants.What if instead they start bowing sarcastically_golf clap_gorf crapThey should start booing every mention of China.How exactly do they hope to enforce this? shoot anyone booing?worked in 89 i get you got the bloke standing in front of a tank, but what actually happened after that? did he just get run over or did a massacre begin?massacre beganThe tank guy was pretty inconsequential to the whole thing, the photo just became iconic and emblematic of the Chinese people's struggle against the oppressive CCP and its brutesquad PLA. Official estimates of the dead is 200-300. That's what Beijing claims, which means the actual toll is without a doubt (and I mean that literally) much higher. Don’t they know how many vets died for that anthem???????It's China itself that is ruining that anthem with the way they are  behaving. The meaning or symbol of something can change with time.I'm not sure if you are being serious or just parodying the typical circlejerk, but the PRC has been behaving like animals as a government since its formation in 1949. There is nothing to ruin. Hong Kong doesnt belong to PRCIf a person with a Hong Kong passport have trouble overseas, whose embassy do they need to contact?People's Republic of China.The sovereignty of Hong Kong were transferred to which country by the British after the 99 year lease is over?People's Republic of China.In name and on paper, Hong Kong belongs to PRC, much like Macau belongs to China, a SAR within PRC.It's a Special Administrative Region *of the People's Republic of China.*I have a feeling this is where the US is headed.Huge difference between private employers saying they don’t want private employees protesting on the job and a government banning all citizens from booing. Even with what Trump has said on Twitter we aren’t in the same stratosphere to this kind of tyranny. Trump would have to pass an EO banning any protests, completely in violation of the First Amendment to come near what China is doing. The POTUS doesn’t have that kind of power. SCOTUS would obviously rule it unconstitutional, and Congress would immediately start impeachment proceedings. Side note: this is exactly why the powers of the executive branch should be limited. Uh, he didn't say that's where we are. He's saying that's where we are trending to. And if anyone was around during the Bush era, they'd know how bad he hyper nationalism can get. You were a traitor back then for questioning the president's very questionable moves. We're likely to go even more extreme.&gt;You were a traitor back then for questioning the president's very questionable movesNot in the eyes of the law. That's the difference.But does it really make a difference, if the POTUS, parts of the media and public condem you for practicing your rights?Ah moral panics. If you haven't read the Wikipedia page on them, they're fascinating. It's the society version of getting blackout drunk, starting fights and pissing your bed, and then afterwards wondering what happened.Uh, it's not THAT different when a private buisness does that after being publically shamed by a head of stateTrump, pence and many other officials in the government have called for the firings of protesters. Some have called for protesters to be run over with cars.We are well on our way there.As far as I know no government official has advocated that people should be run over. The other stuff is right-wing virtue signaling. A majority of Americans don’t like the protests so it’s easy points without actually doing anything. So yes, acting government officials, and the utmost representation of our government itself, have directly called for the firing of anthem protestors.I asked who has called for protestors to be run over, not fired. The former is unforgivable, the latter is a dick move. What politician said people should be run over? Who was it?I know, I'm just clarifying that yes, this "dick move" does happen and its a "dick move" that borders on attacking free speech. And also, there's this guyhttps://twitter.com/AaronBernstine/status/908909823445651457What he’s referring to are people stopping his car with “negative intentions.” What I think he means is that people would stop his car during a protest to assault him. He’s likely referencing the attack on Reginald Denny during the 1992 LA Riots where a truck driver was dragged out of his car by people protesting police brutality and savagely beaten. Still not a smart thing for a State Rep to say, especially when he links it to a specific protest. Without know anything about his personal politics I’m not sure he should be re-elected. &gt; He’s likely referencing the attack on Reginald Denny during the 1992 LA Riots lmao what??? you got that from... that?It’s quite famous, and is an event that is often brought up in the debate over whether or not it’s safe to protest by blocking roads. People in cars have a fear of being dragged out by a mob of people blocking streets. That’s a scary situation for a motorist, which seems to be the State Reps’ actual point. &gt;As far as I know no government official has advocated that people should be run over.Then you don't know very much. Some have.&gt;The other stuff is right-wing virtue signaling. I don't care what you choose to call it in order to make excuses for it. The fact remains that the president of the united states as well as the VP and many other politicians have called for the firing of people who protest and some have called for worse.I don't know why you are working so hard to excuse this act. &gt;A majority of Americans don’t like the protests so it’s easy points without actually doing anything.A majority of Americans don't like any protests. A majority didn't like the civil rights protests, they didn't like the suffragette protests. A majority of the Americans are pieces of shit who don't give a flying fuck about anybody but themselves.What politicians? What specifically did they say? Name them and let’s go get those assholes out of office together. And the majority of Americans just want to watch a football game without being made to feel that they’re somehow subhuman because they don’t dedicate enough of their time to feeling outraged about things that only cursorily affect them. Football was always something that brought us together. It didn’t matter our skin color, we were able to put that dumb shit aside to enjoy this game we all love. When you start politicizing the very things that have historically brought us together as Americans you’re playing with fire. These protests haven’t accomplished anything other than further polarization. People that would be been receptive to the original message of the protests (police brutality and the hope for reform) have been repeatedly told they’re somehow pieces of shit because they don’t like how people protest. That was a tactical error by those supporting the protests that has hurt the overall cause. You can protest however you like. A player could go out and burn a flag in front of 20k people for all I care. It’s his right and I would NEVER say he should be locked up for that. But that guy is still a dick for doing it, and he’s going to have to suffer the consequences. In the case it seems the consequences of protesting during the National Anthem is that people are less likely to make police reforms. Nice work guys. You may have the moral high ground I suppose, but that’s all you’ve got. And if you really think a majority of Americans are pieces of shit, maybe you need to take a look in the mirror and make sure you’ve got everything in check. &gt;What politicians? What specifically did they say? Name them and let’s go get those assholes out of office together.Are you kidding me? Why do you even bother talking about a subject when you know so little about it?&gt;And the majority of Americans just want to watch a football game without being made to feel that they’re somehow subhuman because they don’t dedicate enough of their time to feeling outraged about things that only cursorily affect them.I already addressed this. A majority of americans were against MLK protesting. A majority are against any kind of protests.&gt;Football was always something that brought us together.Bullshit. &gt; But that guy is still a dick for doing it, and he’s going to have to suffer the consequences.Fuck you for thinking there should be consequences for protesting. &gt;In the case it seems the consequences of protesting during the National Anthem is that people are less likely to make police reforms. yea it's their fault the cops are killing black people.Not yours for not giving a damn right?&gt;And if you really think a majority of Americans are pieces of shit, maybe you need to take a look in the mirror and make sure you’ve got everything in check.I think most Americans are like you. They hate protests, they don't care about black people getting killed by cops, they don't want to hear about injustice, they don't give a shit about anybody but themselves. Right, they're just trying to pass laws that make it legal to run over protestors.&gt;Lawmakers in North Dakota, North Carolina, Florida, Tennessee and Texas proposed bills that would make it legal for drivers to hit protesters if the driver did not do so willfully, according to Mick Bullock, a spokesman for the National Conference of State Legislatures.http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/18/us/legislation-protects-drivers-injure-protesters/index.htmlhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-republicans-who-want-to-legalize-running-over-protesters/2017/08/17/f01b7da2-834e-11e7-902a-2a9f2d808496_story.htmlThey also advocated running over protesters.&gt;This is just the latest Republican lawmaker who has, in one way or another, exhibited approval of protesters being run over with a vehicle. Last week, a Pennsylvania Republican tweeted that he would "not stop under any conditions" had anyone ever attempted to "stop my car on a highway with negative intentions." He tweeted it along with an article on a news report about protesters blocking the streets in St. Louis after a white police officer was acquitted in the fatal shooting of a black man.https://www.salon.com/2017/09/20/south-dakota-republican-posts-meme-supporting-running-over-protesters/&gt; The other stuff is right-wing virtue signalingSo when people hear that virtue signaling and act on it, are they virtue signaling too? They're turning up the hostile rhetoric constantly. When does it turn from signaling into obey or else?Limiting the fan’s rights? Why do you think that will happen?As soon as Republicans cave into Trump's whining and allow him to punish peaceful protesters like he wants.[deleted]authoritarianism is the norm not the exception in the world. Many Americans praise anti free speech laws in canada and western europe so long as it aligns their own beliefs.Me too.Get the feeling you need medication of some kind.What are they gonna do, arrest the whole place?Nope, just the Fulan Gong.And if anyone takes a knee, look out.Trump is SO jealous right now...Smh, here in America we do it the smart way: just get the President to single them out individually til public pressure forces them to stop or unemployment Jerry's on Trump's jock.Did they rehash and plagiarize this article from few weeks ago, could've sworn I saw something similarEvery Government that has banned protesting in the past 10 years has been throw out on their ass except one and that one is a War zone. This is what Trump Supporters want, less free speech.I'm sure this will help stifle the dissenters!I'm surprised it's not already. Anything that hurts the feelings of the Chinese is swiftly cracked down uponThat’s a surprise. We don’t even allow that kind of dissent in the US. Try booing the national anthem at a football game here and you’d probably have your ass handed to you. TIL China is freer than the US in some waysWhile the patriotic cult in the us can be really creepy and violent,it's a far cry from the state banning a practice. Getting beaten by some inbred drunk for protesting is different than getting arrested or disappeared by the stateFound another prc warriorWow. Absolutely not. You'll get your ass kicked because you're being an ass. Not to punish dissent. Being free means private citizens can so what they want. Which includes booing the anthem. You have a very twisted view of the country.Woooooooooow there are really people out there like you huh.....And there will be no protests.  Punishment is cheap; one bullet, and the bill is sent to the family. 
Well, it seems that Sessions and Iowa are identifying this as a hate crime. Good.It is a hate crime, if the allegations are true.   For those wondering, the victim is being described as gender-fluid or identifying as both male and female. This either means the victim is intersex or possessing genitalia for one gender while identifying with the other and/or both. The latter is an incredibly common way for trans to present, and this can often be caused by developing differently in the brain and body than the genitalia.  Edit: clarity&gt; A prosecutor says Sanders-Galvez tried to have sex with Johnson and became enraged after learning that Johnson was gender nonconforming.The fuck is that supposed to mean? Besides, a 23-year-old asking a 16 year old for sex is already a bad start. &gt; The fuck is that supposed to mean?It means he was hiding the candy. Wha-AhhhhThanksObviously try this guy and punish him accordingly but many of these crimes against trans have opened up a new can of worms.If a guy consented to having sex with a woman and it turns out she was a man/trans shouldn't there be legal consequences for her? Have we ever seen rape by deception charged or used as a defense in these trap cases?Nobody should be murdered because of their gender, but a man posing as a genetic female for the purposes of a relationship or sex should face charges when it is committed against a person seeking a genetic female. They are purposely deceiving the person.
There is no excuse for punching video surfaces.  Those things are expensive!
